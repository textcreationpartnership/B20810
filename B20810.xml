            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Intent of theſe Papers is to make a more certain Diſcovery of the Senſe of ſome Divine Oracles, which have foretold the Succeſſive Revolutions of all the Great Empires, in which the Church of God was to ſojourn, till it ſhould come to triumph over the Kingdoms of this World. If they prove to be ſatisfactorily clear, Religion and Empire being the Subject-matter of them, They ſeem to be the moſt proper Object of the Meditation of Chriſtian Princes. We are now in the concluding part of the Laſt of theſe Empires; And Your Majeſty's Late Wonderful Succeſſes have ſo promiſing an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb facs="tcp:204884:3"/> on that part of the Predictions, That they ſeem to appropriate all Addreſſes of this kind to Your Royal Court.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore thought it a duty to offer that, which I have already publiſhed on this Subject, to the Hands of His Majeſty; And Your Majeſty's peculiar Share in the Throne does ſeem to demand This of me, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of a Debt from one that has once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached it.</p>
                  <p>This Part is indeed the whole Strength and Foundation of the former, and for that reaſon ought to attend it to the ſame Place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Hopes of a Glorious Succeſs of both Your Majeſties Endeavours for the Revival of the Oppreſſed Reformation. <hi>Madam,</hi> We have already ſeen a very ſurprizing beginning of this Recovery, in the late Providential man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Return of the Proteſtants of <hi>Savoy</hi> through the midſt of their moſt Inveterate, and moſt Powerful Oppoſers. The firſt date of that General Suppreſſion of the Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in <hi>Roman States,</hi> which in the Prophecy is called, <hi>The Death of the Witneſſes in Sackcloth,</hi> is ſuppoſed to commence from the Laſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Abjurations of the new Converts abroad, ſome while after the Revocation of the Edict
<pb facs="tcp:204884:3"/> of <hi>Nants;</hi> And then, That which in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is called, Their <hi>Reſurrection three days and an half after their Death,</hi> muſt fall juſt about the time that the <hi>Vaudois</hi> did Revive, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle</hi> the Publick Profeſſion of their Religion, after their return to their Ancient Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vaudois,</hi> and their Neighbours, have been ſo much the Main Body of the Witneſſes for many Ages before the Reformation, That ſince the <hi>firſt</hi> Revival is agreed from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to be in one particular place only, they may ſafely be allowed to be the firſt promiſing beginning at leaſt of that Revolution. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> did indeed ſeem from the preſent Poſture of Affairs, to be the moſt likely to be the firſt Scene of this Revival. <note place="margin">The other Treatiſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 139, 140.</note> But it has been ſhewn, that there is nothing in the Prophecy that does fix the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it there; And that the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> being executed by the ſame Inſtruments, may very well paſs for one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is the firſt encouraging Earneſt of that Great Deliverance, which the Oppreſſed Church does groan for, and
<pb facs="tcp:204884:4"/> look up to Heaven, and to Your Protection to accompliſh.</p>
                  <p>But whatever may become of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Concluſions relating to preſent Affairs, it will be no prejudice to what I here offer, which is the only neceſſary and Great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the Proteſtant Interpretations, and the ſole foundation of them. It will here appear to remain ſtill firm, and unſhaken, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the main Object of the Judgments of this Prophecy. The Foundation of a Building may be ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Rock, though ſome parts of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure ſhould fall for want of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and cloſe coherence with it. And if this firſt Foundation be but once agreed on, and well regarded by all Parties of Proteſtants, it is eaſie to ſee how influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial it muſt needs be for the ſtrengthening of the Common Intereſt of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The dreadful Characters that are here ſet upon the Common Enemy, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intimations of the joint concern of all the Reformed Churches in the League a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as the Witneſſes, and People of God, And the Preſent Crying Miſeries of their Enſlaved Brethren, are more than
<pb facs="tcp:204884:4"/> ſufficient to make them ſilence all their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Unneceſſary Heats and Animoſities againſt one another, and to make them unite with zeal to ſtrengthen the Hands of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties againſt the moſt refined Barbarities of the Great Oppreſſor, that were ever yet heard of.</p>
                  <p>There are indeed but ſmall Grounds to hope, That Proteſtants will of a ſudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree upon this Foundation, whatever Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there may be for it. The Enquiry into theſe matters is ſo out of faſhion, and lies under ſo general a prejudice, that I found the Preſs every-where affrighted from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the Charge of this Publication. And I am bound to acknowledge, That nothing leſs could perſuade them to it, than the warm Recommendations of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom Your Majeſty's Favour has emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently rewarded for his Long continued La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in all the ways, by which the Church can be either piouſly edified, or learnedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. It is indeed owing to My Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> if any thing here does prove to be of Publick Uſe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:204884:5"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This General Unconcern ſeems chiefly to be the effect of the Popiſh Marriages in the Three Laſt Reigns. Nothing was more the Doctrine of our Church to the end of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, than the Charge of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Antichriſt, upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but it ſeemed ſomething too rude a Charge, both to Church and Court, when the Queen came to be concerned in it; and none but ſome very few of the moſt Sincere and Diſintereſted amongſt the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would appear in it.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore apprehended it to be the moſt effectual way for the making this the Currant Study of the Age again, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Royal Stamp upon it, by Your Majeſty's favourable regard of this Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. I am encouraged to hope, That it may not diſpleaſe the Impartial Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of it. And Your Majeſty's Pious Zeal to promote True Religion and Vertue, has already began to make all good Deſigns for the Proteſtant Intereſt, the Faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Study of all about You. That we may
<pb facs="tcp:204884:5"/> long have the Powerful and Charming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this Great Example for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all Uſeful Knowledge, is the Zealous Prayer of,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE, Concerning the Strength and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Work, and the Confirmation of it by the Event; and the Defects of the Synchroniſms.</head>
                  <p>MOST Writers are ſo happy, as to be able to think themſelves ſure of Readers enow; and all their care is to make them Courteous and gentle by a Preface. But there are ſo few that can have the patience to hear of any thing about the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> that the great difficulty here is to get any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at all, and to prevent the being ſentenc'd without a Tryal.</p>
                  <p>That which does ſo affright the World from theſe things, is the uſual fancifulneſs, and looſeneſs of Diſcourſes of this nature, and their great Confidence and Aſſurance, with little or no care to make ſure of their foundation. I do therefore think it requiſite to aſſure all thoſe that look upon this, That the whole aim of my Endeavours here, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain all kind of Liberty of Imagination, and to force an Aſſent by cloſe, and clear proof, inſtead of ſurprizing it by an Ingenious Scheme, and by the tempting agreements, and lucky likeneſſes of Characters. My great fear indeed is, that the dry ſtrictneſs of the Reaſonings in it, will turn away more from
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:204884:7"/> peruſing it, than the ſtrength and cautiouſneſs of it will pleaſe. But that will ſtill the more clear my Attempt from the common Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſome motive to the belief of this, That the only end of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking was to find out a more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory foundation for what the Excellent Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has endeavoured to demonſtrate in this way; Whoſe known Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for his impartial and cautious Judgment in the interpretation of other parts of Scripture, is ſufficient to ſilence all inconſiderate Prejudices againſt his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of this kind.</p>
                  <p>There have indeed been ſome very great Names of late <note place="margin">Grotius, <hi>Dr.</hi> Hammond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> amongſt our ſelves, who have excuſed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from any concern in the Judgments of this Prophecy; and that, only by laying down another Scheme of Interpretation without any tolerable proof of it. But it is a ſufficient preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt their Authority, that they are forced to ſuch ſhifts for their foundation, as the moſt Judicious, and the moſt skilful of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Interpreters themſelves do cry <note place="margin">See the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> out againſt, as things, that none, but <hi>Men out of their Wits,</hi> would own, and ſuch as they affirm to be <hi>contrary to the general ſenſe of all kinds of Interpreters, Jews and Chriſtians, Ancient and Modern.</hi> And when they come to ſpeak of the like kind of Phraſes, do declare that ſenſe of them, which theſe New Men account monſtrous in the Interpretations of their Brethren, <hi>to be ſo clear, that all, but thoſe that are blind, may eaſily ſee it;</hi> Or ſuch, as is <hi>agreeable both to the uſage of common Speech, and to the uſage of Scripture;</hi> Or ſuch, <hi>as muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be allowed:</hi> Which is a ſufficient Vindication of thoſe Learned Interpreters of our own, who have brought the ſame Charge againſt theſe Ingenious Innovators.</p>
                  <p>It would at the firſt much ſurprize any man to ſee theſe Learned Proteſtants ſo buſie to eaſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of this trouble from their Brethren, when all the thanks
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:204884:7"/> that they can get for it from the moſt Judicious of thoſe, whoſe Cauſe they oblige by it, is to be called <hi>Madmen,</hi> and <hi>fools</hi> for their pains.</p>
                  <p>But in this they themſelves do ſatisfy us. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that they came to the Interpretation of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> with a deſign to ſerve by it; It was more to anſwer Objections againſt ſome ſingular Notions, than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the Myſtery of that Prophecy. They came to force their way through the Difficulties, that the plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſenſe of the Viſions did lay in their way. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ordinary than to ſee men wreſt any part of Scripture, that will not comply with their fancy, for ſome particular Opinions. Their Expedient for Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Chriſtian Churches by the Compliance of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> Their Aſſurace of the neceſſity of the conveyance of a Right Succeſſion, and Ordination by a Church that was not <hi>formally</hi> Idolatrous, &amp;c. were altogether inconſiſtent with the Proteſtant ſenſe of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is as evident on the other ſide from the cloſeneſs and cautiouſneſs of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Explications, and the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of his Judgment upon all other Occaſions, that his whole aim was to make ſure of the clear and certain ſenſe of theſe Myſteries. He bad no private Opinion that he came to advance by it, or to make it a drudge to: And his way of life, and the warineſs, and the Ingenuity of his Spirit in all his other Expoſitions of Scripture, did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſecure him that Character of himſelf, which his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty would only own, <hi>viz.</hi> his freedom from <hi>ſtudium partium.</hi>

                  <p>But the preſent Age is ſo generally prepoſſeſſed with the Interpretations of theſe Learned Men, That it is further neceſſary to remind thoſe, that look upon them as a great ſervice to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That they are great No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties <note place="margin">

As appears by <hi>Leſſius</hi>'s Epiſtle Monitory to them:</p>
                  <p>After that time, This Doctrine of the Homilies came to be more out of faſhion, either to be civil to the Marriages of the ſucceeding Reigns, or to take away all the advantage that the Serapatiſts might have from hence againſt the neceſſity of an uninterrupted Succeſſion and Ordination in every Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully-conſtituted Church; Which might alſo ſhew them the neceſſity of uniting with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the extravagant Heats of thoſe times were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make Learned Men run into unneceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes.</p>
                  <p>But the common Danger of late has now revived the Ancient Doctrine of the Church again, which theſe Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did contradict. All the beſt Learned in the Church have been engaged in charging the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>formal</hi> Idolatry, in expoſing all Expedients for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with it; in demonſtrating the neceſſity of a Separation
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:204884:8"/> from them, whatever becomes of the Succeſſion; in diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all kind of Right of Supremacy there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If therefore the Authority of theſe New Interpreters does ſtill prejudice any (that are otherwiſe curious) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe kind of Enquiries, here is all this to make them very uneaſie under it, <hi>viz.</hi> That they rely upon ſuch for it, as the beſt Judges amongſt thoſe, whoſe Cauſe they moſt befriend by it, do impartially cry out againſt, as Men <hi>void of common Senſe,</hi> for the grounds that they go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it; and that they prefer the Judgment of theſe men in oppoſition to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, and of the beſt Learned, and the moſt impartial De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of it almoſt ever ſince the Reformation, and alſo in oppoſition to the Judgment of all Reformed Churches beſides.</p>
                  <p>I do moreover here pretend to lay a ſurer and deeper foundation for the demonſtration of the Proteſtant Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, than has yet been offered; which may make my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for it at leaſt worth the examining. And for the better apprehending of the force of all, I will here give a general <hi>Idea</hi> of my whole proceſs in it.</p>
                  <p>The chief foundation of my Deſign, is the conſtant uſage of Figures of the like kind in the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For there is this great advantage from <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Figures, That they are both the Original Copy of that in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and have alſo a great variety of like Schemes, and were almoſt all of them fulfilled before the writing of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> as it has been by the Conſent of the Learned <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Conſent of the Ancients <hi>at the end.</hi>
                     </note> of almoſt all Parties, and Ages, agreed upon. This makes the ſignification of the Schemes of <hi>Daniel</hi> to be certainly determined, and to be ſo many <hi>Data,</hi> and Rules for the determination of the like, but leſs known, Phraſes in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> I have therefore taken ſome pains to make ſure of the Interpretation of the Figures of <hi>Daniel</hi> in ſuch a way of proof, as I hope may bear the moſt critical Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:204884:9"/> which was never before clearly done, but is the moſt requiſite of any thing for a full ſatisfaction about the ſenſe of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> For by this means I have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all the kinds of Schemes, ſignifying <hi>Dominion,</hi> to certain and uniform Definitions, which is a much larger Baſis to eſtabliſh the Interpretation of theſe Myſteries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which I found much wanting in Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s, and Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Method. The Prophetical Terms in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> do by this appear to have been well known to the Apoſtle before; and the ſignification of the chief of them, to contain in them ſo large a ſpace of time, as determines their accompliſhment to many Ages after his time, which is a great confirmation of the Divine Authority of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. This is the whole buſineſs of the Second Book, which ought to be the moſt nicely, and attentively exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                  <p>But to make the demonſtration of this the more ſecure, I thought it moſt convenient to make uſe of ſome of the moſt undoubted, and acknowledged things about <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Figure of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which do the moſt openly and unqueſtionably determine the ſcene of theſe things to one certain Empire; Whereby the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is proved neceſſarily to be the ſame with that in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> is more certainly made known; and all the reſt of the Kingdoms there mentioned, more unavoidably confined in their particular ſignifications. This therefore was thought fit to be premiſed in the Firſt Book.</p>
                  <p>In the doing of this, I had another aim, which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be of very uſeful importance; and that was to make ſure of the foundation of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Syncroniſms; that is, That the Term of the Beaſt all over the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> does denote but one and the ſame <hi>particular</hi> ſtate of it; the want of a cloſe proof of which, gives a great advantage to the <hi>Grotian</hi> Interpretation, to evade the force
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:204884:9"/> of his Demonſtrations by taking that Term in various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations. Dr. <hi>Moor</hi> has indeed taken great pains for this purpoſe; but I could not be ſatisfied, till I found it more <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> for that term to be every-where but the ſame <hi>particular</hi> ſtate, than his <hi>Eighteen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities,</hi> or Likeneſſes, do ſeem to make it.</p>
                  <p>The Third Book does apply the general Notions in the Two former, to the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> Thus far I have generally endeavoured to carry on my whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs upon Principles common to all the ſeveral ways of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Interpreters; and have therefore offered mine own particular Apprehenſions about the Application, and firſt date of the Reign of the Beaſt, by way of Queries only; that I might lay the ſtreſs of the buſineſs upon a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion large enough to fit almoſt all the different Judgments of Proteſtant Interpreters, and not venture it upon the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bottom of one particular man's Fancy and Method; And I have made uſe of no Authorities to confirm any thing of moment, but the Conſent of Papiſts themſelves; And their Conſent about almoſt all the Propoſitions in the Firſt and Second Book, which are the Principles and foundation of the Deſign, was a very great confirmation to me of the ſtrength and certainty of all that follows.</p>
                  <p>But yet I am ſo throughly ſenſible of the ſtrange and violent heats, that the ſtudy of theſe things do generally poſſeſs all men with, that engage in it, that I muſt deſire that Juſtice of the Reader not to be deterred from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of this performance, by the confident Cenſures of any that may obſerve ſome ſmall Concluſions here, not ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their own Fancies. For the moſt eminent and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in other parts of Learning, have been found to be the moſt abſurd and groſs in their Confident Miſtakes about theſe matters. Nothing indeed does make men ſo obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to miſtakes here, as a more than ordinary meaſure of quickneſs of Parts, and of aſſurance from great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:204884:10"/> in other ways. If I have at all ſucceeded in this Attempt, I muſt wholly attribute it, under God's aſſiſtance, to the peculiar ſcepticalneſs of my nature, and the continual diſtruſt of my own Apprehenſions and Performances, which would not ſuffer me to fix upon ſcarce any thing, before I had by often repeated corrections of my firſt thoughts about it, made it appear not only <hi>clear,</hi> but <hi>neceſſary</hi> to me.</p>
                  <p>It is enough to revive the Curioſity of the preſent Age for the examination of this Attempt, to reflect but upon the peculiar advantages of it, if performed. My Deſign <note place="margin">The Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Deſign.</note> is to give a clear and neceſſary proof, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that Great Enemy of God's Church, which is much the buſineſs of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And one very great advantage of this would be, That it would cut off many voluminous and intricate Diſputes, which take up ſo much of the choiceſt time of the Beſt Men. If it were once made ſure, That God had here ſo openly expoſed the diſtinguiſhing marks of that Church, almoſt every one of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Notes of his Church ought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſpute, to be granted him. Nay, If that alone be but yielded, which the Jeſuit <hi>Alcaſar</hi>

                  <p>If it ſhould here be ſaid, That theſe 1260 years are to be verified of ſome Empire yet to come; It muſt however be allowed, That the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church is as like that Antichriſtian Empire for all the time that it is to continue,

                  <p>This would make one apprehend, That <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was perfectly infatuated to make choice of ſuch things for the marks of his Church, as make it the very picture of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> the Great in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and ſhews the <hi>Uſe, and great moment of the Notes of the Church, as delivered by Cardinal</hi> Bellarmin.</p>

                  <p>It is another great Advantage of the proof of this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, That the Evidence, by which it is to be proved, is ſuch, as the Capacities of all, that are curious, are moſt
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:204884:12"/> fitted to apprehend, and to be the moſt delighted with, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hiſtories of the Changes of Empires and Kingdoms; Figures that are eaſie Objects of the Fancies and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, and are diverting Reſemblances of real things. So that nothing does ſeem to be more likely to engage the Attention of all Proteſtants to the underſtanding of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their Religion from Popery, than this Method.</p>
                  <p>All the Controverſial part of the proof againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,</hi> has little or no critical curioſity in it; little elſe but what is known by the common uſage of words in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue. In almoſt every thing that is material we agree about the Tranſlation, which in many other Controverſies makes a great part of the Diſpute. There is nothing here of Scholaſtical intricacy, as moſt other ways have. The Text, which is the ground of all, is generally agreed upon; The Hiſtories, that the Application refers to, are on both ſides granted; many Explications of Figures allowed to be plainly expreſſed in the Text in general words; And the almoſt only thing in Controverſie, is, What particular Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the neceſſary ſenſe of thoſe general words compared with what is clearly known from the Text, and from the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of thoſe words in Prophecies fulfilled, and from unqueſtionable matter of fact in Hiſtory. So that a man of the ſloweſt parts, that can but reaſon warily and attentively about common Affairs, or apprehend the like Reaſonings of others, may be able enough with a ſhort Chronology of the Times and Actions that theſe things refer to, to underſtand with eaſe all the proof that is neceſſary for this matter. The only thing requiſite indeed for this, is <hi>a patient Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which the quickeſt Apprehenſions are the leaſt diſpoſed for.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo this further advantage in this way of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mens minds, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Reaſonings will be more eaſily <hi>retained in Memory,</hi> becauſe theſe are generally about things which are wholly the objects of <hi>Imagination</hi>
                     <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:204884:12"/> and <hi>Senſe;</hi> nor will any thing more fix and determine the thoughts of men to it, when it is once apprehended to be clear, without any apparent ground of doubt about it. For what can be a nobler, or more pleaſing entertainment of a mans mind, than to find the moſt conſiderable actions of the civilized World for ſo many Ages (and of the greateſt importance for himſelf to be acquainted with) ſo <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi> foretold, ſo long before, and with ſuch accurate Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of things exactly agreeable to them?</p>
                  <p>One peculiar <hi>Advantage</hi> I muſt acknowledg to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from it my ſelf, which poſſibly may be alſo of uſe to others in the like condition; and that was, The freeing me from all vain deluding hopes of any ſuch Reformation in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as might make way for a general <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of All Chriſtians. For we ſee it impoſſible from this Prophecy, that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould ever ſo change it ſelf, before its final deſtruction. I was once very much taken with the mollifying Pleas of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others of the Reconciling way; and apprehended it poſſible for the chief Heads of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion to condeſcend to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for a general Reconciliation. But when I came to be acquainted with Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Demonſtrations, and had compared them with the monſtrous evaſions, and abſurd ſtrains of wit, that <hi>Grotius</hi> and others were fain to flye to, to turn off the force of them, I gave over all thoughts of the comprehending way, and made it my buſineſs to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſtrength of his Foundation with all the critical caution that I could bring to it. Nothing did more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm me in my hopes to meet with a perfect ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this way, than the great opinion I had of the abilities of the eminent <hi>Grotius,</hi> and the unnatural Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Evaſions that I ſaw him forced to, in contradiction to the known uſe of words, and ſometimes to his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of them; one egregious inſtance of which, is that againſt the uſe of a day for a year, in the Prophecy of the
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:204884:13"/> 70 weeks; where he affirms that the original word for the <hi>Weeks,</hi> does always ſignifie a week of Years, and not of days; whereas it is plain to the contrary, that in all the places of Scripture where it is uſed, it ſignifies literally on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a week of days, as the Learned <hi>Dr. More</hi> has very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved. <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Another great advantage of this Interpretation, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the former, and more immediately influencing the preſent ſtate of Affairs, is, The great efficacy of it, for the uniting of all ſober Proteſtants together, for their common Intereſt: For here may they the moſt livelily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be all <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>the People of God,</hi> ſuppoſed to be in one Common League together againſt that formidable <hi>Dragon,</hi> that ſtands always ready either to deceive and inchant them, or to deſtroy them. This ſhews them not only the great folly, but alſo the ungodlineſs of Schiſms and Diviſions upon unneceſſary grounds, and of their lukewarm unconcern for the means of uniting themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one body.</p>
                  <p>I will not mention other advantages in common to all the Prophetical parts of the N. T. Theſe are enough to incline the Reader to make a tryal of what is here offered; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it is withal conſidered, that my aim is ſtill further to improve the ſtrongeſt and cleareſt method of reaſoning about theſe things.</p>
                  <p>I am not inſenſible, That the ground of many mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt this ſtudy, is, That the Interpreters are ſo fanciful, as to apply the Prophecy to Times and Places near ourſelves But the only fault in this, is the Application of things to particular places and times, without any clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs determination to them in the Prophecy. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, That if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the main concern of this Prophecy, then both the times, and that quarter of the world wherein we live, muſt be the ſubject matter of ſome of the Predictions in it: For they reach to the laſt
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:204884:13"/> end of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore muſt comprehend in them both the preſent Fortunes and Dominions of that Church, which are now no where to any purpoſe, but in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> And ſince I have my ſelf appeared in this way, I am thereby obliged to remove all grounds of Prejudice, upon the account of any thing that I may ſeem to have been too venturous in.</p>
                  <p>I have accounted it the trueſt Rule for the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Prophecy, that concerns the whole Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, ever ſince the writing of it, to chuſe out on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt eminent Events, and ſuch as were of the largeſt Extent over <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> both for Time and Place, and that do withal the beſt anſwer the Characters of the Text. And this Rule I make account, I have been ſo careful to obſerve, that I queſtion not, but that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents which I have pitched upon, will by all impartial Judges be allowed to have had a fair and ſtrong Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them from the Prophecy it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This may appear firſt from my Explication of the Vials. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church</hi> pag. 219.</note> I thought my ſelf forced by the cloſe and immediate Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in the 14th Chapter of my former Treatiſe, to fix the firſt date of the Vials, to the Time ſoon after the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, That being the firſt Victory over the Beaſt, after <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2.</note> which the Plauges that were to humble the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in order to its laſt ruin, did begin. And the Vials being agreed, not to end before the Ruin of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they muſt therefore meaſure out the chief Mortifications of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church from the Reformation till that time; and I cannot but be confident, That I have pitched upon the moſt eminent Mortifications, and thoſe withal, that do the moſt juſtly anſwer the Characters of their reſpective Vial in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, from the Conſideration of thoſe great Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the <hi>Roman</hi> Intereſt ſince the Reformation, which ſeem to be equal to the Plagues of the firſt Trumpets; and
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:204884:14"/> were at the ſame time with the Plague of the ſixth Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and yet uncapable of being ſignified by it; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it poſſible for them not to be ſignified by the Vials; ſince otherwiſe, thoſe eminent Plagues upon that Church, ſince the Reformation will have nothing in the Prophecy that repreſents them; which yet were at leaſt as great Plagues to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> as the three firſt Trumpets.</p>

                     <hi>in Sackcloth,</hi> is the chief of my Applications to preſent times. And I have taken ſuch care in this, that I think I have proved it impoſſible to have happened before our times; and by its nearneſs in the Prophecy to the end of the ſecond Woe, which all conſiderable Proteſtants agree to be the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hoſtilities; and by the time aſſigned <note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>chap.</hi> 8, &amp; 9.</note> to the continuance of that woe, I have not without ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent warrant for it, confined it to this preſent time.</p>
                  <p>I ſee nothing yet, but what does very ſurpriſingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Application. And it will not be improper, nor unpleaſant upon this occaſion, to reflect upon the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that has been given of them by the Event, contrary to what in all humane appearance might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>The Reſurrection of the Witneſſes is there determined <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. p. 107.</note> to three years and an half, after the general Apoſtacy of the <hi>French</hi> Church. For the Death of the Witneſſes is proved to be the perfect Suppreſſion of the Profeſſion of Proteſtantiſm; and that is not, till the Profeſſors of it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>p</hi> 91.</note> that remain behind, <hi>renounce</hi> that Profeſſion. And as the Character of their being in Sackcloth, does confine the place of this to a <hi>Roman</hi> State; So alſo has this been moſt unexpectedly fulfilled by the return of the Proteſtants of <hi>Savoy,</hi> through the midſt of their Enemies, contrary to all humane appearance. They reſetled their publick Worſhip there, juſt about that diſtance of time from
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:204884:14"/> the laſt conſiderable <hi>Abjurations</hi> of the new Converts, which was the moſt proper Death of their witneſſing Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>I have indeed declared, That I thought it much more likely from the outward appearances of things, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution ſhould begin firſt in the proper Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> But I took care at the ſame time, to ſhew that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">P. 107, 139, 140.</note> clear in the Prophecy that did fix it there. And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has accordingly thought fit to make choice of a more unthought-of manner of bringing this to paſs; And yet the <hi>Savoy-perſecution</hi> being carried on by the <hi>French</hi> Troops, <note place="margin">P. 140.</note> and Counſels, I did then ſignify, that it was to be accounted but the ſame place of the death of the Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>I have in ſome places mentioned the Revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> as the date of the death of the Witneſſes, that being the great publick Act that made them ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. But then I have more particularly explained my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about it, <hi>pag.</hi> 107. <hi>viz.</hi> That their laſt expiring is not to be accounted but from the laſt end of the Work of the Dragoons for the general Apoſtacy of that Church; For the Edict it ſelf had an offer of Toleration in private to thoſe who were willing to ſtay in the Kingdom. If ſome ſhould think it fitter to date this time from the end of the <hi>Savoy-perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> then the three years and a half would end at the quiet eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in their Profeſſion ſome while after their return. And let none think the ſmallneſs of the appearance of the <hi>Vaudois</hi> to be too inconſiderable to be thought of by the Prophecy. For beſides that the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Theor.</hi> 32.</note> of the Witneſſes is to be but in one place at the firſt, the <hi>Vaudois</hi> were for many Ages the only conſiderable Party of the Witneſſes. They may therefore be very well accounted the firſt comfortable <hi>Earneſt</hi> of a more <hi>Univerſal</hi> Revival of the Silenced Churches in other places.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Order in the Text I have alſo formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, <note place="margin">

                     </note> That the end of the preſent <hi>Turkiſh</hi> War (as the laſt part of the Second Woe) could not be till ſome time
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:204884:15"/> after the firſt Revival of ſuppreſſed Proteſtantiſm. This we now ſee fulfilled; And yet how contrary was this to all the outward poſture of Affairs, almoſt ever ſince it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, which was in the Year 87? The <hi>Turk</hi> ſeemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have been brought to the greateſt neceſſity of making a Peace. But from that time almoſt ever ſince, they have had ſuch ſtrange Diſorders, and New Changes in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which tended all to the impoveriſhing and dividing of their State; that it was by all the beſt Judges of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs concluded, That it was impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt any longer without it. And on the other ſide, there has been ſuch loud Alarms of a more formidable Enemy on this ſide of the Empire, and ſuch continual Importunities from the Allies in the <hi>French</hi> War, and from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the League of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> to put an end to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> War, and ſo ſmall a diverſion from the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in it to uphold it, that all have thought that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace on that ſide muſt have been precipitated. And yet we have ſeen it deſerred to this time; And the Order of the Prophecy for the end of the Second Woe after the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. From my proof of the time of the <hi>full death of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> I did determine, That there would be no ſuppreſſion <note place="margin">

Nor does it appear, That the <hi>French</hi> in all their Devaſtations of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> ever carried on the Dragoon work of Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt them. And yet how contrary to all outward appearance of things here, was this Conjecture when it was declared, and ſome-while after it? The Project of getting a Complying Parliament to put the ſtrength of the Nation into Popiſh Hands, by nulling the Laws againſt it, was then in a fair likelihood of taking; But upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:204884:15"/> change of Corporations ſoon after, it ſeemed to be out of all queſtion: And the fury with which the Biſhops Conſtancy was entertained, and the Severities of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Commiſſion, were ſufficient Teſtimonies of the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was then taken to bring the Ruling Religion to that ſtate of Toleration, which might qualify them to be the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in Sackcloth.</hi> And who could ever have thought, that the moſt Refined Politicians in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have been ſo unaccountably infatuated, as to chuſe ſuch Methods, as tended the moſt apparently to the ruine of all the fair hopes that their Cauſe was then in? Or that the <hi>French</hi> would be ſo unready to oppoſe His Preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Expedition here, when they foreſaw it; and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had publickly threatned by their Ambaſſador, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all Attempts of that nature? And then for the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,</hi> There was no reaſon to imagine that the <hi>French</hi> Zeal for their new way of Converſions ſhould not have been as hot, as the Flames that they put the whole Country into.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was neceſſary for me in my way of applying the Vials, to make the mortifications of the Imperial, and truly Papal Party by the Reign of the preſent <hi>French</hi> King, to <note place="margin">

And theſe we have ſeen begun to be accompliſhed by as strange means, ſuch as the forcing a whole Nation to that, which they really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Idolatry, by unheard of Artifices; The Change of the Supream Power of a Kingdom, the greateſt Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Proteſtant and Popiſh Princes, that was ever known; The Pope's Excommunications of the fierceſt Zealot of his Church, that ever appeared; The breaking of an handful of Men through the oppoſition of a prepared and powerful Enemy; The ſudden Conqueſt of ſeveral Eaſtern Countries, and a new Revolution in their Government.</p>
                  <p>This wonderful Accompliſhment of Predictions that were particularly foretold, and confined to ſo ſhort a time after, and that alſo contrary to the appearing diſpoſition of affairs, may be a very reaſonable preſumption for the truth of the Principles upon which they rely. But I have every where taken care upon the mention of theſe things, to forewarn <note place="margin">N. B.</note> all, That whatever becomes of theſe conjectures, yet it will not affect the proof that I here offer for the Principles of the Proteſtant Applications. For looſe things may be built
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:204884:16"/> upon a very ſtrong foundation. But I hope theſe will be found not to have been raſhly applied; And then they will be a confirmation of the Demonſtration, <hi>à priori,</hi> here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, As Effects are uſually inſtanced in, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the true Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the chief end of publiſhing the other part firſt, was to engage the curioſity of the World to enquire after this, which was always the chief aim of my Studies about this Subject. For as I was extreamly ſurprized, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Method in the Demonſtrative way; ſo could I not think his preceſs altogether cloſe enough for it, as it has before been obſerved by others. And tho the Learned Dr. <hi>More</hi> has very ſufficiently ſhown, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> of the Objections againſt them, they may nevertheleſs be moſt of them true; yet I do not ſee that he has proved ſome of them, upon which the main ſtreſs of the whole Application does lye, to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be ſo, which is the whole deſign of the Synchroniſm. e. g. The Synchroniſms ſuppoſe for their foundation, that the Beaſt in the 13th Chap. and that in the Eleventh, are the ſame particular state of the Seven Headed Beaſt, which yet <hi>Grotius</hi> ſuppoſes to be <hi>quite different</hi> things, and by that undermines the force of the Demonſtration. Dr. <hi>More</hi> endeavours to strengthen it, by finding a likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Beaſts, in one Character of each; which is far from a Cogent neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>More</hi> himſelf allows not the proof of the Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm betwixt the Beaſt, and the Two Witneſſes in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter, from the end of the Kingdom of the Beaſt, and of the Sackcloth Prophecy of the Witneſſes, at the paſſing away of the Sixth Trumpet; nor does it ſeem to be more <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that the Forty Two Months of the time of the Beaſt, ſhould end before the <hi>Laſt Ruine</hi> of his Kingdom, or when it comes only to be <hi>broken;</hi> which yet is the whole ſtrength of what he adds to defend it.</p>
                  <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:204884:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p> The Third Synchroniſm betwixt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Healed Beaſt in the 13th Chap. ſuppoſes the Beaſt to be the ſame <hi>particular</hi> time and state of <hi>Roman</hi> Power, without any proof; and yet <hi>Grotius</hi> and others ſuppoſe them <hi>quite different.</hi> Dr. <hi>More</hi> endeavours to ſhow them to be <hi>neceſſarily</hi> the ſame, by Eighteen Congruities of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which (tho I think I am ſure, that many of them are not true, yet) are indeed ſufficient to make any Man ſtrongly perſuaded of the perfect identity of the Two Beaſts; But they have nothing in them, that does <hi>neceſſarily</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them to the ſame particular state, and time of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Reign. And yet the whole ſtrength of the <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative</hi> proof of the Synchroniſms depends upon the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of theſe Suppoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Synchroniſm is the total contemporation of the 144000 with the Beaſt, upon the account of their state of mutual oppoſition from the firſt time of the <hi>Marked</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Beaſt: But the utmoſt that this can prove, is, That they were Contemporaries from that time, where they are mentioned together; For the Party of the Beaſt were <hi>marked,</hi> to be diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>ſealed</hi> Company: But the 144000 were <hi>ſealed,</hi> only to eſcape the Judgments of the Trumpets, which are no-where proved <hi>neceſſary,</hi> nor to begin before the time of the Beaſt. And Dr. <hi>More</hi> does add nothing to ſhew it <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and yet the chief proof of the Connexion of the firſt part of the Viſions with the latter, does depend upon this in the firſt <hi>Synchroniſm</hi> of the ſecond Part.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but further add, That Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s and Dr. <hi>More's</hi> Applications of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> and <hi>eighth King,</hi> does ſeem to render the <hi>Synchroniſms</hi> altogether ineffectual for convincing a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> For after they had made the <hi>eſſential difference</hi> betwixt the ſix firſt Heads or Kings, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a different Title of the Civil Sovereign Power of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,</hi> p. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> they make the ſeventh King to be nothing but a
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:204884:17"/> change of the Religion of the ſixth King, retaining ſtill the ſame Title of the <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> which was his <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential difference</hi> from that before him. This ſeems to be contrary to ſix Examples in the ſame Figure, and to almoſt ſix times as many in the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel.</hi> A <hi>Papiſt</hi> would therefore hold them to their true Notion of the ſixth Head, and then pretend, That the Imperial Title does continue ſtill as the ſixth Head, and that the <hi>Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms</hi> cannot therefore take place, till that be changed.</p>
                  <p>All this I mention, only to ſhew, That there is ſtill want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a clearer Evidence, to make good that excellent Deſign, towards which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> did give the firſt great ſtrokes, and for which he is to be acknowledged to have been the firſt clear Light that God gave the World for the illuſtration of theſe dark Myſteries, which now appear to be the worthieſt Entertainment of the beſt and the moſt judicious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. This I have endeavoured to perfect: But I muſt ſtill acknowledge, That tho I think my ſelf ſure enough of the ſtrength of my Method for it, yet I do not pretend to that which is <hi>ſtrictly</hi> called <hi>Demonſtration;</hi> It is enough for me, if I can proceed but upon ſuch clear grounds, and go on in ſo cloſe a coherence from them, as to force the aſſent of all wary and impartial Examiners of it, with as little doubt concerning it, tho not with ſo <hi>Abſolute</hi> a Certainty of it, as Mathematical Evidence uſes to do.</p>
                  <p>I dare however be confident, for the encouragement of the Reader, That if he has found any ſatisfaction in the grounds of any Proteſtant Interpretations, that others affirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>Abundantly and Mathematically certain of,</hi> he will find them here much more cautiouſly and ſtrongly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; and that the Elegant Syſtemes which have of late <note place="margin">

                  <p> I think I may alſo ſafely venture to aſſure the Friends of the <hi>Grotian</hi> way, That the leaſt degreee of impartiality in them will make them ſee it here ſhewn to be <hi>MUCH MORE CERTAIN,</hi>

                  <head>THE SEVERAL OPINIONS CONCERNING THE BEAST IN THE APOCALYPSE.</head>
                  <p>IT is generally agreed by all the conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of all Churches in this preſent Age, That <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> in the Viſions of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> do ſignify ſome Idolatrous State of <hi>Roman</hi> Reign. For they all agree, that by <hi>Babylon,</hi> muſt be meant ſome Domination of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there are three main Differences amongſt them in reſpect of the Age to which they fix their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. <hi>Some</hi> do apply theſe Viſions to the Affairs of <hi>Rome-Heathen,</hi> and ſo maintain, that the time of the concern of theſe Viſions is already paſt. <hi>Others</hi> apply them to the times of Antichriſt, near the <hi>end of the World,</hi> who contend, that the matter of them is not yet begun to be fulfilled. And <hi>others</hi> again, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them of the <hi>preſent times in which we live, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages paſt,</hi> ſince the time of <hi>Rome-Heathen.</hi> There
<pb facs="tcp:204884:26"/> are ſome other Opinions, that are a mixture of theſe; but theſe are the only conſiderable Differences of the Interpreters of our preſent Age.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe that lay this Scene in <hi>Rome-Heathen,</hi> they make The Beaſt conſidered as the common Subject of his Heads and Horns, to be the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And when that Term is uſed only for <hi>Him,</hi> who is called the <hi>Eighth King,</hi> it is then the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation under that particular King, or He himſelf Ruling the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> are Seven Perſecutions of <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, either of ſo many <hi>ſingle</hi> Emperors, or of ſo many <hi>kinds</hi> of perſecuting Emperors.</p>
                  <p>Of this Opinion are the lateſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, and <hi>Grotius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe that defer the Application of theſe things to ſome State of <hi>Rome, near the end of the World,</hi> are more uncertain. They will have many of the things that are ſaid of <hi>Babylon</hi> alone by it ſelf, to belong to <hi>Rome-Heathen;</hi> but far the greateſt part of the Account of it, and all that concerns the Hiſtory of the Beaſt, they determine to the time of the appearance of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, three years and an half before the end of the World, according to the litteral Acceptation of that ſpace of time, mentioned five ſeveral times within the compaſs of three Chapters. Therefore are they forced to make the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſignify, <hi>The World of wicked Men in general,</hi> when taken for the <hi>common</hi> Subject of its Heads and Horns: But the <hi>particular</hi> State of it, when uſed to ſignify the <hi>Eighth King</hi> only, they determine to be either ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Antichriſt, or (which is much the ſame) the Devil in Antichriſt in the time of the Reign of Antichriſt, as the 7th King in the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories. The <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> they would have to be <hi>Seven Ages</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:204884:26"/> 
                     <hi>of the World,</hi> with the ſeveral Tyrants againſt the Church of God in each of them; the Sixth of which was that Age in which St. <hi>John</hi> lived, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Five are past, One is,</hi> which appears to be the ground of all this Opinion, that they may make the Sixth Head continue from St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, to the time of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, near the end of the World, whom they make to be the Seventh.</p>
                  <p>Of this Opinion, are almoſt all the <hi>Roman</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ground themſelves for it upon the general Opinion of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> concerning the three years and an half of the Reign of Antichriſt, near the end of the World. And <hi>Alcaſar</hi> ſays of them, that they think it <hi>ſo certain,</hi> that there is no doubt to be made of it. <hi>Diſput. in Argument. totius, cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Apocal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Alcaſar</hi> himſelf is of another mind, and after twenty years Labour in this Study, ſays, <q>That it is plain from the Characters of the Beaſt in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and from its Alluſion to the Ten horned Beaſt in <hi>Daniel,</hi> That this whole Beaſt is nothing but the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Diſputat. in Argument. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Apocal.—</hi>And that to fly to the Kingdom of the whole World for the Beaſt, and to make the Seven Heads to be Seven Ages in it, is ſo forced, and wreſted an Interpretation, that any one may obſerve it. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſput.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. <hi>in cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Apoc.—</hi>
                     </q>And that <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion does offer a fair occaſion to the Hereticks to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as being at laſt to be an Apoſtate from the Faith.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> does thus cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the firſt opinion, that interprets all of <hi>Rome</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and which therefore is forced to interpret the firſt part of the Viſions of the ruin of the <hi>Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> or Synagogue, as <hi>Salmeron</hi> and <hi>Alcaſar</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<pb facs="tcp:204884:27"/> ſo alſo <hi>Grotius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> He ſays of this opinion, <hi>in Prolegomen. in Apocal.</hi> 
                     <q>That it is 1. an Innovation. 2. Myſtical, not Hiſtorical. 3. Of a Prophecy, it makes the Apocalypſe an Hiſtory; for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate was down before the writing theſe things. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was againſt the agreeing-ſenſe of the Fathers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſays further <hi>in the ſame place,</hi> 
                     <q>That tho it was not flattery, yet it was only a Love to, and Reverence for the Apoſtolick See, and a zeal for the honour of it, that put <hi>Alcaſar</hi> upon this opinion, as he himſelf does ingenuouſly confeſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ribera</hi> ſays poſitively, That he is blind that does not ſee, that the judging the Dead (v. 18. cap. 11. Apoc. which <hi>Grotius,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Alcaſar</hi>'s way, interpret of the time of <hi>Rome-Heathen)</hi> cannot be fulfilled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of the laſt Judgment, <hi>Comment. in cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Apocal. Numer.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>The Cenſures of both the Two former Opinions, by the moſt eminent of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Interpreters, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonably plead an excuſe for a Third advanced in their ſtead by the Proteſtants; and that is this,</p>
                  <p>That the Beaſt in general, is the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> but when taken for the <hi>Eighth King,</hi> is <hi>The Preſent Ruling Power of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church:</hi> That the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of the Beaſt, are Seven ſucceſſive Changes of <hi>Roman</hi> Government: That the <hi>Sixth</hi> of them, ſaid to be in being at the time of the Viſion, is the Imperial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: The change of that into another form, the <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Seventh King:</hi> And the next to that, The Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Soveraignty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is the <hi>Eighth, which is of the Seven:</hi> And therefore the Three Years <note place="margin">v. 11.</note> and an half, ſo often mentioned by Months and Days, muſt be ſo many Prophetical Years, as there are days in that Period, according to the Examples that there
<pb facs="tcp:204884:27"/> are in Scripture, to take a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year,</hi> in a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Senſe.</p>
                  <p>For this they ſeem to have all the Premiſes, which are the main foundation of their Concluſion, from the opinions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Interpreters themſelves. The General Notion of the Beaſt, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they have from <hi>Alcaſar, Bellarmine,</hi> &amp;c. to whom agree <hi>Grotius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>

                  <p>As alſo their acceptation of the Seven Heads for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Governours, from the ſame; Their making the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads to be ſo many ſucceſſive Lines of <hi>Roman</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, each of which contains under it a long Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſingle perſons of the ſame ſort, is according to <hi>Alcaſar</hi>'s Notion of the Heads: And <hi>Ribera,</hi> tho he makes them not <hi>Roman</hi> Heads, yet contends much for <note place="margin">In cap. 13. <hi>Apoc.</hi> ſect. 2.</note> their being Seven general ſorts of Sovereign Power, each of which contains under it a ſucceſſion of many <note place="margin">In cap. 17. <hi>Apoc.</hi> num. 15.</note> ſingle Rulers of that kind, according to all the known Examples of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and other places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And then ſince the Prophecy ſays of one of theſe Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> That he was in being at the time of the Viſion; that could be no other ſort of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, that contained a Succeſſion of many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſons under it, but the Imperial Government of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the determining of this does thereupon make it neceſſary, that the reſt of the Heads or Kings ſhould be other Titles of the Government of <hi>Rome;</hi> And what then can be pitched upon for this end, with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than thoſe other Changes of the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are frequently recorded by the <hi>Roman</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Kings, Conſuls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatever were the Five firſt Kings, yet it is leſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, that that which is called the Beaſt, muſt be the
<pb facs="tcp:204884:28"/> next Change of <hi>Roman</hi> Government but one, to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial, that was in Rule at the time of the Viſion. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory does aſſure us, That there has been at leaſt Two ſuch Changes ſince that time; and that therefore The Beaſt muſt be ſomewhere in being at this preſent, in the Ruling Power of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he is deſcribed to continue with <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Seven Hills, to the Univerſal Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore do they conclude, That it muſt be the preſent Ruling Power of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it is deſcribed to be a <hi>Roman-</hi>Church-Power, and it cannot poſſibly be any where elſe than there.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all contending Parties, to be the only diſtinct Prophecy that we have of the ſucceſſive fortunes of the Chriſtian Church, from its firſt Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the end of the world. This they all agree in, for the matter and ſcope of the whole Book, tho' they infinitely differ about the Explication of the ſeveral parts of it. And there cannot be a greater invitation to engage the curioſity of any that are concerned for Uſeful and Important Truths, than that Conſideration. The great variety of the apprehenſions of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters about theſe things, ought not to diſcourage mens hopes of a clear Interpretation, more than the ſame differences amongſt them about almoſt every other Book of Scripture: For it will be found, that they do almoſt as generally agree about the firſt Grounds of the Interpretation of theſe Viſions, as about other Books of Scripture, that ſeem to be leſs myſtical. The Language of Prophecy, already explained by accompliſhments, is in theſe things as ſure a Rule of Interpretation, as the more common Language of Scripture is for the other Books of it, that are more plain. And thoſe that ſeem the moſt impartial in theſe things, <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mede,</hi> B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. <hi>Uſher,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>More.</hi>
                     </note> are very confident, that there are plain grounds upon that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build a demonſtrative Evidence of the Senſe of the chief deſign of theſe Viſions upon.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:204884:30"/>
                  <p> With this encouragement, it will be firſt enquired, What ſure grounds there are for the certainty of the Apoſtolical Authority of this Book, as the only foundation of all ſatisfaction that can poſſibly be had from the cleareſt Interpretation of it?</p>
                  <p>There are two ways by which the Authority of any Book of Scripture is ſecured to us: The Firſt, An Univerſal Tradition concerning it in the firſt Times of the Church, ſoon after the writing of it; And the Other, The Determination of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church concerning it, after ſome doubts and ſcruples concerning it. And by both theſe ways of aſſurance is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> ſecured.</p>
                  <p>Two of the firſt Writers, after the writing of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> were, <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus. Juſtin Martyr</hi> was contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with thoſe who knew the Apoſtle whoſe Name it bears, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 160.</note> and that converſed with him; and He, in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> pag. 308. quotes the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> about the Thouſand Years, under the Name of, <hi>A certain man amongſt them, who was one of the twelve Apoſtles of Chriſt, ſpeaking of that matter, in the</hi> Revelation <hi>which was given him;</hi> which all know to be the Subject of the 20th Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> And accordingly does <hi>Euſebius,</hi> l. 4. c. 18. <hi>Eccl. Hiſt.</hi> quote <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> as attributing the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to the Apoſtle St. <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Irenaeus</hi> does the moſt ſatisfactorily put an end to all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about this in his time; and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was contemporary with <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi> And to aſſure us of the truth of what he affirms, he ſays he had it from <hi>Polycarp,</hi> whoſe diligent Auditor <note place="margin">Lib. 3. contra Haereſ. cap. 3.</note> he was; and <hi>Polycarp</hi> was a Diſciple of St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf, and died a Martyr, and ſo ſecures the truth of his Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Teſtimony concerning the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> is moſt full in his fifth book <hi>contra Haereſ. ſect. ult.</hi> where ſpeaking of the Number of Antichriſt, he ſays, That <hi>that Number was in all the ancient and approved Copies; and that he had it alſo confirmed to him by thoſe who had ſeen St.</hi> John <hi>face to face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There can hardly be given a more unqueſtionable, or more particular Teſtimony concerning the true Author of a Book at any diſtance from the time that it was wrote in, than this is. Here is a particular ſearch after all the Copies of it, ſoon after the writing of it, with the concurrent Teſtimony of thoſe who knew the Author himſelf.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:204884:30"/>
                  <p> And further to ſhew the utter unlikelihood of any falſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Name of the Author of it, a little after, ſpeaking of the Name of Antichriſt,<hi>—Knowing this,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that if his Name</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 5. ſect. ult.</note> 
                     <hi>were to have been openly known at this preſent time, it would certainly have been expreſsed by him who ſaw the Revelation: for it is not long ago ſince he ſaw it, but almoſt in this preſent Age, at the latter-end of the Reign of</hi> Domitian. The little diſtance betwixt the time of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and the time of the writing this Book, together with the care that he took to look into all the various Copies of it, and the Traditions of the Ear-witneſſes of the Apoſtle about it, and the confirmation of his own Teſtimony in all this, by dying a Martyr himſelf, does ſilence all ſcruples about the Apoſtolical Authority of this Book.</p>
                  <p>But yet about 100 years after the time of <hi>Irenaeus, Dionyſius</hi> of <note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Diſputes againſt the <hi>Millenaries</hi> of his time, does affirm, That many of his Predeceſſors did reject this Book: But then he ſays, <q>It was becauſe they ſaw it obſcure, and full of too groſs ignorance about the <hi>Millenarian</hi> ſtate; not from any new knowledge they had got of the forgery of it.</q> And their grounds were ſo ſmall for it, that tho' he was the chief Head of the <hi>Anti-millinarian</hi> Party, yet he ſays he believed it to be divinely inſpired; <q>Tho' from the difference of the Style of it from that of the Goſpel and Epiſtles of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, he judged it to be wrote by ſome other <hi>John</hi> contemporary with him.</q> And yet there are ſome expreſſions in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> ſo peculiar to the Goſpel and Epiſtles of <hi>John</hi> the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, and uſed by no other Apoſtle, that it muſt be either He himſelf, or a very near Friend of his, that muſt be the Author of them; ſuch as are, <hi>The Lamb; The Word; The bearing record,</hi> or witneſs of the <hi>Word; They that pierced him, ſhall ſee him; The Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt; He that overcometh; As I received of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will give unto him that is athirſt, of the fountain of the water of life freely;</hi> and <hi>Let him that is athirſt come; And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely:</hi> Which are all expreſſions peculiar to the Goſpel and Epiſtles of St. <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Jerem</hi> indeed ſays, That the <hi>Greek</hi> Church rejected the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it: But, as <hi>Baronius</hi> well obſerves about it, <hi>An.</hi> 96. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> muſt neceſſarily mean <hi>that</hi> only of the meaner and lower part of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; For, as he there ſhews, almoſt every one of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers does quote it under the Name of St. <hi>John</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:204884:31"/> Apoſtle. And <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who relates the diſſent of ſome of the Ancients about it, and was the moſt eminent Antiquary of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, does name <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Melito</hi> of <hi>Sardis, Theophilus Antiochenus, Origen, Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> the chief Writers of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church before him, as Aſſerters of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Authority of this Book.</p>
                  <p>If we go to the Judgment of after-Ages, we have the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Conſent of the Chriſtian Church for the Canonical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> after it had been ſcrupled by ſome; which is the other way of aſſuring the right Tradition of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Book.</p>
                  <p>The third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> after the time of theſe ſcruples of the <hi>Antimillenarians,</hi> and before the degeneracy of the Church, to which the aim of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> is applied by Proteſtants, <hi>viz.</hi> before the year 400, does in its 47th Canon ordain the Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to be read in the Church, as Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And this Provincial Council is confirmed, to oblige the Univerſal Church, both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> by the ſixth Synod in <hi>Trullo</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople, Can.</hi> 2. <hi>Anno</hi> 707. But it was unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably a Decree of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, where the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> had alone been ſcrupled.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt authentick Evidence of this, is the Authority of the fourth Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> when it could not poſſibly be any Intereſt of the then Ruling Party of the Church to plead for the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> but might poſſibly enough endanger the Intereſt of it; becauſe it was about the year 640. after the time that the Proteſtants Applications of that Book do generally date the degeneracy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from. So that the ſenſe of that Council is the Teſtimony of an Adverſary to the General Conſent of the Church about the Tradition of this Book. The words of it are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Authority of many Councils, and the Synodical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees <note place="margin">Concil. Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. 4. Can. 16. about the year 640.</note> of the holy Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> have determined the Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to have been wrote by <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and to be received amongſt the Books divinely inſpired. And becauſe there are many that do not receive it for Authentick, and ſcorn to read it in the Church of God; if any one for the future ſhall refuſe to receive it, or to read it in the Church, in the time of Maſs, from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> he ſhall be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p> By this it does appear how the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> came to loſe its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticalneſs among the meaner part of the Church: It was, it ſeems, ſo diſuſed in the Church, that it paſſed for an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Book; the Interpretations that were given of it, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo fanciful, or ſo little concerning the Times when it was neglected, that it paſſed amongſt them for a kind of Book of Dreams, in which the Church was not concerned, and which none knew the meaning of. And this cannot much be wondred at, when it is conſidered how little regard is had to theſe <hi>Revelations,</hi> even in theſe days, unto which they are, by the beſt Learned amongſt us, judged to belong in matters of the higheſt importance for the Church to know.</p>
                  <p>But as for that ſuggeſtion, That <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was the Author of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> (which was always the moſt current ground amongſt thoſe who rejected the Authority of it), there is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance enough of the falſhood of it out of <hi>Irenaeus;</hi> for he was the Scholar of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who was the Diſciple and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of St. <hi>John,</hi> (to whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> every-where attributes <note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 5. Eccleſ. Hiſtor. c. 18.</note> the <hi>Apocalypſe),</hi> and writes againſt <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and reports from <hi>Polycarp</hi> the great deteſtation that St. <hi>John</hi> had againſt <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</hi> And how abſurd a thing would it be to imagine, that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> after ſo diligent, ſo long and familiar a converſation with <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the Companion of St. <hi>John,</hi> as he particularly mentions of himſelf, ſhould make the Apoſtle to be the Author <note place="margin">Lib. 3. contra Haereſ. cap. 3.</note> of a Book which was really wrote by his worſt Adverſary to propagate his Errors?</p>
                  <p>Whatever was the true reaſon of the rejection of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Prophecy, it is certain, That no Book of Scripture has had a more expreſs and unexceptionable Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Apoſtolical Authority, ſince it was confirmed by the Teſtimony of two Learned Martyrs ſoon after the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, who alſo had ſearched into all the Copies of it, and were confirmed in it by thoſe who were converſant with the Apoſtle himſelf that wrote it; and that in the very times that it was ſcrupled, it was believed to be Authentical by all the Eminently-learned Fathers of thoſe days; and that after the times that it had been ſcrupled, it was owned by the General Conſent of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:204884:32"/>
                  <p> This I thought fit to premiſe, for the full ſatisfaction of thoſe that are altogether ſceptical in the firſt foundation of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations. But the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> whoſe whole concern it is to make every thing in this kind dubious, do agree with all other Chriſtian Churches in the World at this time about the unqueſtionableneſs of the Canonical Authority of this part of the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>And now it may appear to be our Duty and Concern to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire with diligence after the beſt underſtanding that we can get of this Prophecy, when we conſider what preſſing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives there are to it, more in this Book than in any other Book of Scripture beſide.

                           <hi>The Ground of the Method here uſed. The firſt Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That</hi> Babylon <hi>is the City of</hi> Rome <hi>in an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and Idolatrous Reign. Scruples moved againſt it. The Demonſtration of it from the Text, confirmed by General Conſent.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOne could be more diſpoſed to the common prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the ſtudy of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> than I was at the time that I firſt engaged in thoſe things. I had till then been ſo almoſt wholly confin'd to ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries as are the cloſeſt Exerciſe of Ratiocination, upon clear and ſure grounds, That I was come to have a natural averſion againſt all ſuch looſe Conjectures, as the Interpretations of thoſe Viſions are generally reputed to be.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Synchroniſms,</hi> and his offers at Demonſtration in them, which I lighted on by chance ſome years ſince in a ſolitary retirement, did tempt my curioſity to enquire, What could be the ground of ſuch a confidence in one of ſo known a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:204884:33"/> Character for a cautious and imparial Judgment in Scriptural <note place="margin">Rev. XVII.</note> Expoſitions. At the firſt curſory view of his performance, I was extremely ſurprized to ſee ſuch fair grounds of a clear Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication about ſo intricate and obſcure a Subject: And tho' up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more critical examination of the ſtrength of them, I found moſt of his <hi>Synchroniſms</hi> far ſhort of a cloſe and cogent proof in them; yet I could not but think that the Subject might be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a more certain determination to the Concluſion that he aimed at.</p>
                     <p>I did thereupon ſet my ſelf upon a particular ſearch after a cloſer demonſtration of that Application that he had made of the main ſcope of theſe Viſions; and at laſt thought I had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at what I was in ſearch of.</p>
                     <p>The late dangerous Circumſtances that I apprehended the True Religion to be in, made me think I was obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate my thoughts of theſe things to the Publick; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knew that I ſhould have a very ſagacious Adverſary, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by a Ruling Intereſt, engaged againſt me with all that ſcorn and fierceneſs that the charge of the Characters of <hi>Babylon</hi> upon the <hi>Roman Church</hi> does uſually raiſe in them, I thought it neceſſary to review the coherence of my former thoughts, and to take care that I never concluded upon any thing till I ſhould ſee a moral neceſſity at leaſt for it from the evidence of the Grounds upon which it depended. The great importance of the thing, made me think it worth all theſe pains; and the fear of betraying the Cauſe of Religion, inſtead of aſſiſting it, and of giving a falſe Charge, of ſo heavy and dreadful a nature, upon ſo large a part of the Chriſtian Church, made me conclude, That I could not be too ſlow and cautious in my determinations about theſe matters. And therefore, if the ſcrupulous Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, with which I examine this Subject, ſhould ſeem tedious and troubleſome to any, the nature of the dangers that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to avoid by it, and the aim that I propounded in it, of arriving at a certain and clear foundation of ſatisfaction about theſe things, may very reaſonably excuſe it: And tho' I do not here pretend to any more Certainty or Demonſtration, than the Interpretation of another's meaning in a Writing is capable of, yet I am encouraged to hope, That I ſhall be allowed, by thoſe that are Judicious and Impartial enough, to have here ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the aim that I propounded to my ſelf, ſo far at leaſt as I poſitively affirm or conclude.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:204884:33"/>
                     <p> In this deſign, the firſt thing that offers it ſelf, is that which ſeems to be the cleareſt thing in the Prophecy, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be apprehended to be the foundation of all the reſt; which is, That</p>
                     <q>Babylon <hi>in the 17th Chapter of the</hi> Revelations, <hi>is the City of</hi> Rome <hi>in an Antichriſtian and Idolatrous Reign.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>To abate the Evidence of this Propoſition from the Angel's Interpretation; I found that there were not only various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the ſignification of <hi>Babylon,</hi> much different from what it is here made to be; but alſo that they were countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Perſons of the greateſt Authority for Integrity, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſound Judgment. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes <hi>Babylon</hi> in this place to be only the general City of Wicked Men all the World over; and thoſe that were moſt converſant in theſe things ſoon after his time, and the moſt judicious in them, <hi>Primaſius, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas Caeſarienſis, Arethas,</hi> make it indifferent, to be <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or the general Society of Wicked Men; and even Proteſtants themſelves do ſome of them agree to this, notwithſtanding the great advantage it would be to their Cauſe to have it to be the City of <hi>Rome</hi> only.</p>
                     <p>But then one cannot but be ſurpriz'd again, to ſee the moſt Learned and Judicious of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo very poſitive, That <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot poſſibly be any thing but the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> as, <note n="a" place="margin">

And theſe Characters we find alſo expreſly fixed to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, when they could not be underſtood of any other Place; as, <hi>The ſeven Hills where the Woman ſitteth;</hi> that is, at this preſent time: <hi>The City which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth;</hi> that is, at <note place="margin">Ver. 9, &amp; 18.</note> this moment; or at that time when the Angel ſpoke to the Apoſtle all along that Chapter, to unfold the Myſtery to him.</p>
                     <p>From theſe plain Circumſtances, I could not think it would be any dangerous venture to be confident, That <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt be <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:204884:34"/>
                     <p> For who can think it poſſible for an Angel of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the firſt place to explain the myſtical terms of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to an Apoſtle of Chriſt; then to go on immediately to perform it by Characters of them, which were very peculiar and individual Properties of things that were alone known to have them, and by which they were generally known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be meant in the common converſation of the world: and to fix them alſo to a certain time when they were ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed; and yet after all this, that the Angel might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them in a much different ſenſe? How then is it poſſible to know the meaning of the plaineſt words in Scripture, if in ſuch circumſtances as theſe an Angel of God could have given ſuch an invincible temptation to the world to deceive themſelves, without any poſſibility to prevent it? I could not therefore judge it poſſible, that <hi>Babylon</hi> here ſhould be any thing elſe but <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I was ſtill the more free in, becauſe I ſaw it the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> of thoſe, who, tho' they make the outward Teſtimony of a Church their ordinary Rule to judge of any divine infallible Truth, yet here ſpeak with all imaginable aſſurance about a thing which their Church never defined, upon the account of the over-bearing evidence of the Text for it: and this alſo freed me from all fear of any partial prejudice againſt their Church, that might make me too ready to join with the reſt in this great aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>As for the wavering Opinions of others about it, I knew it to be no ſtrange thing to find Learned and Worthy Perſons of different Judgments about the moſt certain, and even the moſt undeniable Truths, either upon the account of former prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or want of ſufficient conſideration, or from an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indifference for ſome things, or from ſome peculiar propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to others; ſo as ſometimes to maintain very plain Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to the common ſenſe of men; as it was of old obſerved of the ſubtileſt Reaſoners in the world, That <hi>there was nothing ſo abſurd, which was not maintained by ſome or other of the Philoſophers.</hi> I had read of very learned Scepticks, that doubted of the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mathematical Demonſtrations; had known many Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Worthy Perſons, that could not ſee any abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the moſt difficult Notion of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> and much more eaſie is it for the beſt men to apprehend, That
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204884:35"/> in the cleareſt Explication of a Myſtery, as this is, there may poſſibly be a further Myſtery.</p>
                     <p>Let the reaſon of the indifference of others have been what it will, we are ſure, That if any myſtical Figure ſhould be now ſaid by an Angel to ſignifie the moſt Chriſtian King with the <hi>Flower-de-Luces;</hi> or the moſt Catholick King, who has the Gold Mines of <hi>America;</hi> or the Port, that rules over the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> we ſhould moſt aſſuredly conclude, That no other King now or hereafter could be meant by it, but the King of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain;</hi> nor any other Port in the World, but the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, or <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And it would be altogether incredible to us, That any learned Perſon ſome hundreds of years hence, that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the common uſe of thoſe terms in this Age, ſhould be ſo extravagant as to think that this might be meant of any other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Catholick</hi> King in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, or of ſome other great <hi>Eaſtern Port,</hi> ſome hundred years hence.</p>
                     <p>The MOST SATISFACTORY inſtance of the wild imaginations of Learned Men on ſome occaſions, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has given us of it in the very Caſe before us. Whatſoever was the reaſon of it, it is certain that he is in expreſs terms repugnant to himſelf in two contradictory Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about this thing: For in his ſecond Book <hi>de Pontifice,</hi> cap. 2. <note n="m" place="margin">

                     <p>And now I may ſeem to have been unneceſſarily tedious in theſe laſt Reflexions; But ſince I have found by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the general prejudice to me, and to moſt of the World beſide, againſt the cleareſt things in theſe Viſions, was the ſtrange different Apprehenſions of very Judicious Men about them; I thought my ſelf obliged to ſtay long enough upon the conſideration of the inſignificancy of that Scruple, to take off all the power of it for the future; and this will, it may be, prove to be of greater uſe, than it may at firſt be apprehended to be.</p>
                     <p>After this ſatisfaction about <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Subject of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Propoſition, I found at the firſt ſight, that what is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>Babylon</hi> in it, muſt be acknowledged to be unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> as it has alſo the general ſuffrage of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The former Propoſition made the Standard to judge</hi> what kind of Evidence <hi>is ſufficient to make one ſure of the Interpretation of any thing elſe in the Prophecy. And</hi> Four Rules <hi>of Interpretation drawn from it. The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of them.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Was not ſo vain as to think I had got much by the undoubted Certainty of the former Propoſition, to give me any hopes of much better ſatisfaction about the reſt of the Interpretation. For in all my former perplexities about theſe things, I never queſtioned the certainty of this. And beſides, I ſaw this to be generally acknowledged by thoſe, who yet differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in almoſt every thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>But however, ſince this was the only certain truth, that was then known about theſe things, It was neceſſary to enquire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what general Suppoſitions it did rely to make it uſeful for a foundation for further advances; according to the beſt method of finding out unknown Truths, where the Reſolution of one Problem diſcovers many General Theorems at the end of it very uſeful for farther improvements; as it is alſo the moſt eaſie, ſure, and natural order of Science, from particular Inſtances to draw forth the General Rule ſuppoſed in them for all like Caſes.</p>
                     <p>And this great advantage have we from the certainty of this particular Inſtance, That it determines both what kind, or degree of Evidence is ſufficient to make a man ſure of any other Concluſion in theſe matters; and alſo, what would be ſufficient grounds to ſecure any, that there was that degree of Evidence in it. For, whatever it is that makes this ſingle Truth appear to be ſo unqueſtionable, muſt be acknowledged to be ſufficient to ſecure the certainty of any other Propoſition that has the ſame grounds in it. And this I conceived to be of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in all further ſearch into theſe Obſcurities, To have ſuch a <hi>Criterion</hi> or Standard of the true value of every thing that ſhould offer it ſelf.</p>

                     <p> Firſt then, for the KIND of EVIDENCE, that from hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſufficient for ones aſſurance of any thing hereafter; it need be no greater, than that which makes men ſure of the meaning of any plain words of Scripture of unexceptionable Authority. For of that kind is the certainty of this Inſtance. It is not an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence grounded upon the neceſſary connexion betwixt the thing, and its eſſential properties, as Mathematical Demonſtrations are; or ſuch, as it may be proved to be abſolutely impoſſible to be otherwiſe in the nature of the thing.</p>
                     <p>It would be hard to prove it abſolutely impoſſible from the nature of God's Veracity, that he ſhould have a further myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meaning in expreſſions, that ſeem very plain to us, for ſome great good ends unknown to us. But yet this is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his ordinary way of revealing his mind, and ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inconſiſtent with the perfection of his Veracity, that we cannot but be confident, that he means always, as plainly as he ſpeaks; unleſs he gives clear intimations to the contrary to aſſure us, that he has an hidden meaning, either by its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to ſome Truths far more clearly known, or by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of the plain ſenſe of the words with that wherewith it is joined, or the like.</p>
                     <p>From hence therefore it will be expected, that whatever <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, Metaphyſical Reaſons</hi> a man may have to doubt of it, one ought not to ſcruple the certainty of any thing, that has the ſame grounds to make us ſure of it, that the ſeveral parts of this Propoſition rely upon; for that would be of equal force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſenſe of the plaineſt Expreſſions of Scripture. And beſides, it would have the teſtimony of the unanimous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the differing kinds of Parties and Intereſts in the World againſt it, whom we find to be all agreed about ſome of the parts of this Propoſition, <hi>only</hi> from the plainneſs of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions about them, notwithſtanding all the wild Poſſibilities only of their being otherwiſe meant.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it would be thought very reaſonable, that one ſhould look upon the ſeveral grounds of this preſent Inſtance, as ſo many General Rules to aſſure us of the certainty of every thing elſe in theſe Viſions, that was eſtabliſhed upon them.</p>
                     <p>For this end, it may be obſerved, in the firſt place, that the chief ground for concluding <hi>Babylon</hi> to be <hi>Rome in the Angel's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it,</hi> and its Reign to be an Antichriſtian Tyranny
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204884:38"/> againſt the Church of Chriſt, <hi>before the explication of it</hi> at the 6th verſe, is the common uſage of the Expreſſions in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate known ſignification; eſpecially when compared with the Angel's promiſe to explain the Myſtery with an intention to have it underſtood: It may therefore from hence be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>

For the clearer proof of this, it may be obſerved, That</p>

Wherefore by Rule 1. it muſt then be the ſame time of <hi>Babylon</hi> juſt before the 17th Chapter, that is mentioned in that Chapter: ſo alſo by Rule 3. <hi>Babylon</hi> the Great being a very peculiar Myſtical Expreſſion, muſt ſignify

The Antichriſtian Tyranny of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 18. 20, 24. and Chap. 19. 2. is ſignified to be the ſame with that Chap. 17. 6. And 4.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> does in all thoſe places of the Prophets, to which the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of it do here allude, ſignify the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Throne, or Monarchy. 2.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in its Antichriſtian Domination (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 1.) 3. And the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Prophets, for which the ſame Expreſſions with theſe here are uſed, does ſignify the laſt end of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or Ruling Power. 4. And beſides, It is the general <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> uſage of the Prophetical Writings, to ſet out the laſt Ruine of a Ruling People by the deſolation of the chief City of that Nation at the ſame time. Thus is the Ruine of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael, Judah, Egypt,</hi> and of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> repreſented by the Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Samaria, Jeruſalem, Noph</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> 5. But more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> particularly is it ſet forth in this Prophecy, that the deſolation of <hi>Babylon</hi> is not after the end of that Monarchy, which it here repreſents. For <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> whoſe Heads do repreſent this City, and is himſelf called the King of it, is not dethroned till after the deſolation of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the 18th Chapter, as appears Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters 19, 20.</p>
                     <p>And Chap. 16. 14, 19. The Judgment upon <hi>Babylon</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the meeting of the Strength of that Monarchy in <hi>Harma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon,</hi> and the laſt end of it in the 19th Chapter.</p>
                     <p>From hence it appears, That</p>
                     <q>Babylon <hi>in none of the mentions of it in the</hi> Revelations, <hi>can be</hi> Rome <label type="milestone">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204884:41"/> But that Prophecy was after that of <hi>Jonah,</hi> in whoſe time the people of <hi>Niniveh</hi> are ſaid to have believed in God, and to have repented, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 5, 10. And ſo the Idolatry of <hi>Nineveh</hi> after that time, was her Apoſtacy from the true Faith.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is much more confirmed from the preceding Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For <hi>Babylon</hi> is, in all the mentions of it, the ſame Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtate of the Reign of <hi>Rome</hi> (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 2.)—And in that ſtate of it, it is deſolated by Fire (by <hi>Propoſ. praeced.)—</hi>But this was never known to have been done in the time of the Reign of <hi>Rome-</hi>Heathen. There was nothing that had the leaſt appearance of the deſolation of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the diſſolution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, at <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Triumphs over Paganiſm; much leſs was there any thing like the leaſt part of the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deſolation of <hi>Babylon</hi> by fire, as it is here moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſignified.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> to uphold their applications of theſe things to <hi>Rome-</hi>Heathen, will have <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Babylon</hi> two hundred years after it was come under the Chriſtian Emperors, becauſe there were a part of the Senate, and now and then a Conſul, that were Pagans, for that ſpace of time after <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s Triumph over Paganiſm; and therefore, that the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Babylon</hi> by fire, was at the burning of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Totila, An.</hi> 546. where the ſtorm of the Enemies fury lay almoſt wholly upon the Pagan Party, and the Chriſtians were moſt ſaved by flying to the Churches.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, it may here by the way be obſerved, what becomes of the ground of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s confidence, That the things in the <hi>Revelations</hi> were all to be fulfilled in the Times next to the Age in which they were ſeen, from what is ſaid Chap. 1. 1. <hi>Things that muſt ſhortly come to paſs.</hi> For here are near five hundred years time allowed by the Doctor for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling them. And then he makes the <hi>Turks</hi> alſo to be foretold in them beſides, by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> which requires ſome hundreds <note place="margin">Chap. 20. 8.</note> of years more; and yet the Doctor ſpeaks with a great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and aſſurance of the fulfilling of all, ſoon after the time that the Prophecy was given.</p>
                     <p>But without further concern about that, let us now obſerve the ſtrange abſurdities of this Explication.</p>

According to this, <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> for 200 years after that the <hi>Bayloniſh</hi> Throne in it had been pulled down, and when its conquering Enemy, the Chriſtian Church, had been for all that time triumphing in its room, in the Imperial Throne, in the publick Laws, in all parts of the Government, and in the publick places of Divine Worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then <hi>Rome</hi> Chriſtian, whilſt it was the poſſeſſion of a <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 20.</note> Chriſtian Prince, muſt be ſuppoſed to be burnt, to bear the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, for ſhedding the Blood of Chriſtian Saints and Martyrs, ſo many years after that Heatheniſm had been there publickly triumph'd over.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Chriſtians alſo, who did then defend their City againſt <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 4.</note> another Chriſtian Prince, muſt be ſuppoſed to be called upon from Heaven to come out of it, and ſo to give up their Maſters Right to the Enemy, leſt they ſhould be made to partake of the puniſhment of <hi>Rome,</hi> for its Heatheniſm 200 years before, to which they were the greateſt Enemies; for none was more zealous againſt Paganiſm, than <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who was at that time Lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the ſeverity of his Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Rome</hi> muſt again be ſuppoſed in this way to have been in the height of her Wealth and Riches, by which ſhe is deſcribed in her Idolatrous ſtate, as decked with Gold, and Pearls, and Precious Stones, at the time that ſhe was burnt by <hi>Totila:</hi> For it is ſaid at the burning of her, That <hi>in that one hour was ſo</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. How monſtrous a force alſo upon the Text muſt it be, to make <hi>Rome</hi> the Object of the fierceſt Wrath of God, at a time when ſhe was every-where owned for the Queen of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, only for having ſaid in her heart ſome hundreds of years before, in her Pagan ſtate, <hi>I ſit as a Queen, and ſhall know no ſorrow?</hi> But, indeed, the plain words do repreſent her <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 7.</note> ſaying in her heart, juſt about the time of theſe laſt Plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, <hi>I ſit as a Queen,</hi> &amp;c. which does plainly ſignifie, That the Ruling State, in which <hi>Rome</hi> is to be at the time of this laſt end of her, is the Object of this Judgment: And this in <hi>Totila</hi>'s time, being a Chriſtian Government, the boaſt of the Reign of Chriſtianity then, under the term of <hi>ſitting as a Queen,</hi> would, according to this, be the reaſon of the Deſolation of it, under the Notion of a Pagan Empire.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And what can that cry of the admirers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> v. 18. be underſtood of, but of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>at that time</hi> the Seat of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire?<hi>—What is like unto this great City?</hi> Now, what were the <note place="margin">Rev. 18. 19.</note> Pagans in <hi>Totila</hi>'s time the better for <hi>Rome</hi>'s being the Seat of a great Empire, which was contrary to their way? How come

Or wherein was it then ſo great in Empire before the burning it, or ſo leſs after it, when it had not been the Imperial or Royal Seat for above 100 years before that time; and was by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, but returned into the ſame hands that it had been in for near 50 years together but ten years before that time, and when preſently after it was returned again into the ſame hands that it was taken from, within a few months after the burning it, and was then repaired again?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And this laſt Conſideration of the return of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour again to the poſſeſſion of the City, within ſo ſhort a time; is evidence enough, That it is impoſſible that <hi>Totila</hi>'s Exploit ſhould be the burning of <hi>Babylon</hi> in this place, even by a Rule that <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf has ſet up about the ſignification of the word <hi>for ever,</hi> upon ver. 19th Chap. 3. where it is ſaid, That <hi>the ſmoke of the burning of</hi> Babylon <hi>aſcended up for ever:</hi> He ſays, That whenever that term <hi>for ever</hi> is joined with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a City, it ſignifies, That it ſhall not recover again of a long time; whereas <hi>Rome</hi> was re-built the next year after the burning a ſmall part of it by <hi>Totila.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will not here inſiſt upon the ſignifications of a final Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon thoſe emphatical expreſſions, which at firſt ſeem to deſign ſuch a thing, becauſe I ſee all the ſame phraſes uſed by the Prophets of the fall of Cities, as the Seats of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which yet continued conſiderable Places after that, under other Rulers.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But that which ſeems the moſt inexcuſably to condemn <hi>Grotius</hi>'s fancy, is, That moſt of theſe expreſſions concerning the Deſolation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> are uſed in the Prophets for nothing but the end of a Monarchy that enſlaved the Church of God; and which alſo they do of themſelves moſt of them naturally ſignifie. Thus are the People of God commanded to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> juſt before the overthrow of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy; <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 8. &amp; 51. 6, 45.</note> and the expreſſion it ſelf does naturally ſignifie, That the Body of the People out of whom they were to come, were <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and ſo therefore muſt the chief Body of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s People have been Idolatrous, and Enſlavers of his People.</p>
                     <p>So alſo the rejoycing over <hi>Babylon</hi> at her fall, and the calling <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 14, 48, 29.</note> to the People of God to reward <hi>Babylon</hi> double of what ſhe had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204884:43"/> done to them, and the riches of <hi>Babylon</hi> at her deſolation, and the name of <hi>Babylon the Great,</hi> ſaid at that time to be deſtroyed, and her Greatneſs admired by thoſe that lamented her at the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 8.</note> time of her fall, and the Kings of the Earth who had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fornication with her at that time bewailing her, do all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſignifie, That <hi>Babylon,</hi> at the time of her deſolation by fire, is then a Nation oppreſſing the People of God, in great ſplendor in that way, and bewailed by perſons who themſelves had been partakers in her Glory; and ſo are they uſed by the Prophets from whence they are fetched, about the end of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore impoſſible, that <hi>Rome-</hi>Chriſtian burnt, ſhould be <hi>Babylon</hi> deſolated by fire.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. It is alſo to be remembred, That the ſignification of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> in this very Prophecy, has been already concluded to be the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in an Eccleſiaſtical Domination, <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. And therefore muſt the fall of it be the laſt-end of that <hi>Roman</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and not the laſt-end of the Favourers of it only. And then how inconſiſtent is it, to make the burning of <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Domination quite contrary to that Church-rule, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Babylon,</hi> to be the ruine of <hi>Babylon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. To conclude, <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Explication of the Characters of falling <hi>Babylon,</hi> do ſome of them ſuppoſe, That <hi>Rome</hi> at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it by <hi>Totila,</hi> was actually at that time a Seat of Empire; and the reſt, That it was a Pagan City; neither of which were true. The deſolation of it, he underſtands only of the loſs of the Imperial Majeſty of it, the diſtinction of the People of God from it; and the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he interprets of its being a Pagan City. Now <hi>Rome</hi> had not actually been the Seat of the Empire for above an hundred years before: <hi>Ravenna</hi> was the conſtant reſidence of the Emperours, and Kings of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and had left off being a Pagan City ever ſince the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reformation of it by <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> for a few Pagan Temples cannot make the contrary Government of a City have the name of a Pagan City.</p>
                     <p>Here then we have a ſufficient earneſt of what <hi>Grotius</hi> is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of venturing at in the Interpretation of theſe Viſions, and is enough to prevent all the danger of being over-born in any thing here by the Authority of his Judgment only.</p>

                     <p>But the certain Obſtacles againſt this are, firſt, That <hi>Rome</hi> muſt thus be ſuppoſed to get the Conqueſt of all Nations, <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 18.</note> and of all the Kings of the Earth, within three years time, (for that is made to be the time of her Reign); and not only to get ſuch a miraculous Conqueſt in that time, but alſo to make all Nations own her Idolatry in that ſpace of time; which muſt be a far greater Miracle than ever God <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 2.</note> yet ſuffered the Devil to work in the World; and that alſo againſt all the Light and Reſolution of mens Conſciences to the contrary, which is a more difficult matter to bend againſt the Natural Courſe of it, than the ſubject-matter of any other Miracle.</p>

                     <p>And then this makes it at leaſt very highly probable, That the time of forty two months, or of one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days of the Reign of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with <hi>the Beaſt</hi> who carries her, and to whoſe Seven Heads ſhe is always fixed, muſt be underſtood in ſuch a myſtical ſenſe, as will give time enough for the things that are deſcribed to be done in that Reign, and according to the uſe of ſuch parts of time in a myſtical ſenſe amongſt the Prophets, by <hi>Rule</hi> 3. which will make the time of <hi>Babylon</hi> to begin many Ages before the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>From hence then it appears, That we have this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement already for our hopes of a clear Determination of the Application of this Prophecy, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That there are but three ways yet pitched upon for the Application of it; that is, to <hi>Rome-</hi>Pagan, to <hi>Rome-</hi>Chriſtian, and to <hi>Rome</hi> about the end of the World: The firſt of which has been found to be very Abſurd, and the laſt Incredible. And this is an inviting fore-taſt of the ſatisfaction that may be expected from the more orderly and cautious Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Grounds of all clear Determinations concerning theſe Viſions.</p>

                           <hi>Inferences drawn from the former Chapter, to diſcover the Nature of the Three laſt Heads of the Beaſt, and the time of the Reign of the laſt, called,</hi> The Beaſt. <hi>An Account of the Author's Method.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE determination of the Reign of <hi>Babylon</hi> to the times after the end of <hi>Rome-Pagan,</hi> which ſeems now to be unqueſtionable, does offer a very fair light for ſome general diſcoveries about the Myſtery of the Beaſt, and his Heads, which ſeem by the order of them to be deſigned to be the Clue to direct us in the intricate Mazes of theſe Viſions.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>the Beaſt</hi> are repreſented as inſeparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in the 17th Chapter. <hi>The Beaſt</hi> ſeems to be confined to that City by his Heads, which are ſaid to be the ſeven Hills up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the City is ſeated. And ſince it is already known what City <hi>Babylon</hi> is, it cannot then be doubted but that <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> who is ſaid to be a King, muſt be the King of that City. So that if the Reign of <hi>Babylon</hi> has been clearly proved to be after the time of <hi>Rome-</hi>Pagan, the Reign of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> muſt alſo be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be as long after that time.</p>
                     <p>Now if any part of the Reign of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> was in being ſo long after the time of the Viſion, this does plainly determine what kind of Kings the Heads of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> muſt be, whoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions ſeem to be given on purpoſe to meaſure out the time betwixt the date of the Viſion, and the appearance of the laſt of them in Rule, called <hi>The Beaſt;</hi> for <hi>the Beaſt</hi> is determined by the Prophecy to be the third King in order after Him who reigned at the time of the Viſion. He is ſaid to be an Eighth to <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 11.</note> him that was a Sixth at the time of the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>From hence would any conclude, That ſince the eighth of theſe Kings, or <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> is found to be in Rule after the time of <hi>Rome-</hi>Pagan, that is, ſome hundreds of years after the time of the Viſion, that His Reign, and the other two Reigns before him from the time of the Viſion in St. <hi>John</hi>'s days, could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be the Reign of three ſingle perſons only; for there were near three hundred years betwixt the time of the Viſion, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:204884:46"/> the full end of <hi>Rome</hi> Pagan, before which the Reign of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>The Beaſt</hi> have been proved impoſſible to be: And within that ſpace of time there were above thirty Succeſſions of ſingle Perſons in the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne.</p>
                     <p>It would therefore next be neceſſary to enquire from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Hiſtory, what elſe the firſt of theſe three Kings, who is ſaid to Reign at the time of the Viſion, could poſſibly be. It will appear from thence, that there was no other King of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, but a ſingle Emperour. Wherefore ſince it has been found impoſſible, that it ſhould be the ſingle perſon of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who is meant by the King then Reigning; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that can be meant by it, but that form of the Supreme Government, which the Emperour's Title gave name to, or the Imperial Government then in power. And conſequently, by the ſame reaſon, muſt all the three Kings, of which <hi>The Beaſt</hi> is ſaid to be the 8th, or laſt, be ſo many ſucceſſive Changes of <hi>Roman</hi> Government from the time of the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>Since therefore the firſt of theſe three Kings is known to be the Imperial Government in the days of St. <hi>John;</hi> all that ſeems needful to be done to determine the time, and the particular form of <hi>Roman</hi> Government, that is called <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from Hiſtory, what ſucceſſive Changes there have been in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government ſince the time of the Viſion. For the next Change but one to the Imperial Government in thoſe days, muſt certainly be <hi>the Beaſt.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is ſo far of the ſame mind in this, That according to him, the true ſtate of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them and us in this Affair, is, whether the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Government at the time of the Viſion has ever ſince that time been cut off, which makes him take ſuch pains to prove, That the ſame Imperial <hi>Roman</hi> Government continues unchanged to this day: And thus all the difficulty that remains, ſeems according to him to be no more than to enquire after, and rightly judge of the matter of Fact from Hiſtory. For he grants, that nothing can be meant by <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> his Heads, and Horns, but <hi>Roman</hi> Power: Tho' he takes no notice of the diſtinction, and order of Succeſſion amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>THE SEEMING evidence of the Concluſions before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, even in the judgment of the moſt Zealous, and the moſt able Defender of the <hi>Roman</hi> Intereſt, is a very ſatisfactory proof, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204884:46"/> the Angel, that offered that Explication of the Myſtery to the Apoſtle, did really intend to be underſtood, according as one would expect from the promiſe of an Explication of a Myſtery from ſo Divine a Perſon. And this is a great encouragement to any, that is willing to take the pains for it, to ſearch after the true means to determine the right ſenſe of this Explication. The Angel firſt promiſes to unfold a Myſtery, begins it in very known Expreſſions, goes on in other Characters, that ſeem to be clear. Who would not then poſitively conclude with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the main ſtrokes, and Myſtical Characters in which it is expreſſed, muſt certainly be intelligible enough by ſome means in our power, eſpecially when we find ſo many Excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this Prophecy to underſtand it?</p>
                     <p>But I ſaw ſo many miſcarriages in attempts in this way, and could find ſo little clear ſatisfaction in the moſt cautious Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, that I was afraid of nothing more, than of being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied about theſe things too ſoon. There are ſuch fair Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and grounds for ſtrong Preſumptions, That the greateſt danger lies in being too ready to cloſe with a ſeemingly obvious Senſe of the Angel's Explication. My aim was at aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in theſe matters; and the beſt way for that, I concluded to be, To ſearch for difficulties to counterpoiſe the too much prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Inclination to haſten to a determination. There ſeemed to be a great variety of ſhows of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> which <hi>Grotius</hi> makes a great advantage of to the baffling of all the force of the beſt Demonſtrations, drawn from the Synchroniſms of the ſeveral deſcriptions of it in the ſeveral Chapters.</p>
                     <p>There ſeems alſo to be a great ambiguity in the notion of <hi>The Beaſt.</hi> There are no diſtinguiſhing Characters of the Heads from <hi>The Beaſt</hi> himſelf, nor of their Nature in general, nor of their Conſtitutive differences from one another; and it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a preſumption to make all the reſt of the Heads to take their determinate form from what was diſcovered to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſixth Head; upon which nevertheleſs does depend all the hopes of coming to a particular knowledge of the time of the Reign of <hi>The Beaſt:</hi> and without the knowledge of the particular time of that Reign, it is in vain to think of any thing of this nature.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Conſiderations made me conclude, That the Angel's Explication did ſuppoſe, and direct to ſome other known Key
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:204884:47"/> to come to a full underſtanding of his mind. It was obvious thereupon to apprehend, that <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> and his Heads, and Horns, being very myſtical kind of Expreſſions, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the clearer knowledge of them, to conſult the common acceptation of them amongſt the Ancient Prophets in like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to theſe here before us, according to <hi>Rule</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>I was ſoon ſatisfied in this. I found by the unanimous <note n="a" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>But I was extremely ſurprized to find alſo, That by the ſame Unanimous agreement of all the Conſiderable Interpreters of all Ages, excepting only ſome few of this laſt Age, it was granted, That the Terms of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and their Heads, or Horns, and indeed all other Figures and their parts ſignifying Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as it is here in theſe Viſions, had but one conſtant, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Signification in general all over the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and that alſo in great variety of Inſtances: And withal, That by the concurrent agreement of thoſe few alſo, that differed from the reſt, there needed nothing more to prove ſuch a conſtant, uniform Signification of theſe Figures, but only this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>The Fourth Beaſt,</hi> or Kingdom, in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> was the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>This gave me very confident hopes of fixing the ſame kind of myſtical Terms in the Viſions of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> to ſetled No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and certain Definitions, and thereby of coming to ſome aſſurance about thoſe things, notwithſtanding all the ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and various acceptations of the Expreſſions, in which they were conveyed; which I accounted well worth all the cloſeſt application of my thoughts, as a thing of the moſt uſeful importance to the World for the clear determination of the aim of this Prophecy, as well as for mine own particular ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and benefit.</p>
                     <p>I have therefore for this end endeavoured to demonſtrate the conſtant, uniform acceptation of the Schemes of <hi>A Beaſt,</hi> and its parts, all over <hi>Daniel:</hi> And this requiring the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Interpretation of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> or Kingdom, in the Seventh Chapter of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and the determinate applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that, relying chiefly upon the determination of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204884:47"/> ſignification of the Kingdom of the Son of Man that ſucceeds that Fourth Kingdom; Theſe make up the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the deſign of the Second Book from the Intrinſick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But the cleareſt proof of the ſignification of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is the exact agreement of it with <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> And that alſo in ſome ſuch peculiar Characters amongſt the reſt, as are impoſſible to belong to more than one and the ſame Kingdom, and to the ſame time of that Kingdom: This therefore is added to the other Evidences that are drawn from the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> it ſelf, as a moſt undoubted confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> or Kingdom in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who indeed would not be ready to conclude with himſelf, before ever he comes to examine the grounds that there is for it, That ſo general an agreement of all the differing Parties of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters for ſo many Ages, as has been obſerved, about Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expreſſions, where there is ſo great a ſcope for Fancy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate in, muſt certainly have very plain and expreſs grounds for it in the Prophetical Writings, and very obvious to common obſervation? And this is another conſiderable thing to fortify the aſſurance that the ſtrength of the Proof it ſelf does offer.</p>
                     <p>But the Characters in which <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> does ſo exactly agree with thoſe of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and which are the ſureſt Proof, That that <hi>Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> muſt be the Kingdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> are fetched from ſeveral diſtinct Shews of the <hi>Apocalyptick Beaſt</hi> in ſeveral Chapters: And theſe ſeveral Shows are by ſome Learned Men judged to be the Shows of different <hi>Beaſts;</hi> whereas the proof of the exact agreement of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> with that in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Characters of thoſe different Shows, does ſuppoſe it to be but one and the ſame <hi>Beaſt</hi> in all thoſe Chapters.</p>
                     <p>This made it neceſſary to ſettle the notion of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the 17th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and to ſhew, that all the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that which is called <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in all the other Chapters, are but ſo many Accounts of that one and the ſame particular ſtate of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> that it is found in in the 17th Chapter: And that therefore all the ſeveral Characters of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Chapters, are but the Characters of one and the ſame thing. And this it was requiſite to prefix in the Firſt Book
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204884:48"/> before all other reaſonings that are fetched from the nature of that <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the following Diſcourſes.</p>
                     <p>After the determination of the conſtant and ſetled ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and of the parts of it ſignifying Dominion, from the frequent uſe of thoſe Schemes in <hi>Daniel;</hi> The buſineſs of the Third Book is to apply theſe general Notions to <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and to the parts of it: And from the known ſignification of that Head of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> which in the Prophecy is ſaid to reign at the time of the Viſion; and from the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Succeſſion of the other two Reigns after it, to determine the time of that particular ſtate of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> which is by way of eminency called <hi>The Beaſt</hi> alone by it ſelf, and the Eighth King; and which is the Great Subject of theſe Viſions.</p>
                     <p>And then the Explication of all the Uncouth Characters of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> is the laſt Finiſhing-work of this Deſign in the Fourth Book.</p>
                     <p>And this may give the Reader a diſtinct and comprehenſive view of my whole Deſign at once, and of the Order of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod towards it.</p>

                     <p>THE foundation of all ſatisfaction about the certain time of that Idolatrous Reign of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is ſignified by <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> does ſeem to depend wholly upon the means that are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Angel's Explication to determine the time of the Reign of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> which appears all over the Prophecy with that City as its inſeparable Companion. There ſeems to be no other means left to fix that particular time, but the Succeſſion of the Heads of <hi>The Beaſt;</hi> the three laſt Reigns of which ſeem to be on purpoſe ſingled out from the general ſum of the other five, and to be diſtinctly mentioned one after another, for no other end, but to direct us from the knowledge of the firſt of the three (ſaid then to be in Rule, when theſe words were ſpoken, and ſo might eaſily be known) to determine the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> who is made to be the next Reign but one after that Ruling-Power, which was then in preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>But before any thing can be well ſetled upon this bottom, the uſe of the Term of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> muſt be firſt ſufficiently cleared. For it ſeems to have an ambiguous Signification in it, which may defeat all our hopes of fixing it to any determinate mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it ſeems to ſignify a thing common to all the Seven Heads, when it is repreſented as the common Subject of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:204884:49"/> them all in their ſeveral ſucceſſive Reigns; and ſometimes it ſeems to ſignify nothing but one of its Heads in diſtinction to all the reſt. Wherefore it ſeems to be the firſt thing that is to be enquired after, Whether there can be any determinate and fixed ſignification ſetled upon the uſe of this Expreſſion: And the fear of miſtaking in ſo fundamental a Point, made me think it neceſſary to be very cautious of every ſtep I made in it, and to have a diſtinct comprehenſion of it, before I ſetled my ſelf upon it.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe I found it requiſite to begin with this <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> as the ground of all that was to follow.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Every one of the Eight Kings reckon'd up in order</hi> (Rev. 17. <note place="margin">Propoſit. 4.</note> 10, 11.) <hi>is one of thoſe called the Seven Kings in general,</hi> v. 10.</q>
                     <p>Nothing can well be more plainly ſignified, than this in the Text after this manner; <hi>They are Seven Kings, Five are fallen, one</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, muſt continue a ſhort ſpace; and the Eighth is of the Seven.</hi> What can more plainly ſignify the parting the whole ſum of the Seven Kings men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned juſt before, into <hi>five,</hi> and <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>the other;</hi> and <hi>an Eighth which is one of thoſe Seven?</hi> For who would ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe words otherwiſe, than in this plain ſenſe. They are <hi>Seven</hi> Kings, <hi>Five</hi> of which <hi>Seven</hi> are <hi>fallen; One</hi> of them <hi>is,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> of the <hi>Seven</hi> is <hi>not yet come,</hi> &amp;c. And there is an <hi>Eighth,</hi> who <hi>yet</hi> is one of thoſe <hi>Seven</hi> before mentioned. So that every one of the <hi>Eight</hi> is one of the <hi>Seven,</hi> and therefore can there be but <hi>Seven Kings</hi> in all.</p>
                     <p>This indeed ſeems to be ſo very plain and neceſſary, that it may be wondered why it ſhould not be rather ſuppos'd, than endeavoured to be proved, ſince there ſeems to be no manner of ground for a doubt about it, but only upon the account of the <hi>Eighth King;</hi> who yet (to make all clear) is ſaid expreſly to be an <hi>Eighth</hi> which was one of the <hi>Seven,</hi> and is ſo granted to be without diſpute. But yet it was thought needful to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this by theſe Reflexions upon it, becauſe there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Authority againſt it in defence of a particular Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</p>

                     <p> That which is alledged from the Text to make it capable of another ſenſe, is, <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>More,</hi> Vol. 1. p. 647. <hi>Brightman,</hi> in V. 10. c. 17.

                     <p>But it is plain enough, that <hi>the other</hi> in that place denotes no new quality in the 7th King, but only refers to the ſignification of the number of the King juſt before him, who is called <hi>one;</hi> And that King is called <hi>one</hi> by a very proper and familiar way of Speech, without any ground for the leaſt myſtery in it, ſuch as this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing would now be accounted: The Seven Heads are Seven Kings, <hi>five</hi> are paſt, <hi>one</hi> is at this preſent; after which would very naturally follow, and <hi>the other</hi> is not yet come: That is, <hi>the other of the ſeven,</hi> which is an uſual and ordinary way of ſpeaking, if not more proper, than to ſay, <hi>five</hi> are paſt, the <hi>ſixth</hi> is at preſent, and the <hi>ſeventh</hi> is not yet come. And certainly the 7th would in the latter Example appear to be nothing but one of <hi>the ſeven</hi> Kings, who had at firſt been called the ſeven Heads.</p>
                     <p>When with this we conſider there is mention here made of an 8th, Can any thing be more manifeſt, than that <hi>the other</hi> juſt before it, is as certainly the 7th, as if it had been expreſly ſo called? and that the <hi>one</hi> before that, is the ſame with the 6th? And then of what can they poſſibly be the Sixth, or the Seventh, but of thoſe Seven Kings, which were juſt before ſaid to be the ſeven Heads, and which immediately after the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, were divided into <hi>five, one,</hi> and this <hi>other?</hi> There is certainly no manner of ground to think the <hi>one</hi> in this diviſion, to be one of the Seven, more than <hi>the other.</hi>

                     <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon the perfect clearing of this, becauſe it is the foundation of all the Hiſtorical Application that can be made of the 8th King, called <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> which is the great buſineſs of all our ſearch; and I hope there needs no more now to make it unqueſtionable, that the Seventh King is one of the <hi>whole ſeven</hi> mentioned before in <hi>general,</hi> in the firſt words of the 10th <hi>Verſe;</hi> and ſo that every one of the Eighth Kings is alſo one of thoſe ſame Seven, ſince the Eighth is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid to be one of the Seven.</p>
                     <p>To this the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Interpreters do generally agree. They <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> make the firſt ſeven Kings to be the ſeven Heads, and the Eighth to be the Devil, common to them all; and ſo no new Head, or new King diſtinct from thoſe ſeven, that are mentioned before him.</p>
                     <p>To recompence the length of the former Diſcourſe, here are theſe following fruits of it:</p>
                     <q>The Eighth King is one of the ſeven that had been in Rule before it, and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Corollar. </seg>
                        </label> was returned into Power again.</q>
                     <p>For the Eighth King is one of the ſame whole Seven men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in general, that the reſt are comprehended in (by Prop. 4.) And therefore the whole Eight are really but Seven diſtinct Kings; and the Eighth comes after Seven of them diſtinctly reckoned up before him. The Eighth muſt therefore be one of thoſe former Seven returned into Power again; according as it is intimated of him, That he is one of the Seven.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do apply that term, <hi>And is of the ſeven,</hi> to the Devil, as being in all the other Seven Kings.

                        </gap>, does properly ſignify the being one of that number of Seven juſt before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, eſpecially when he appears here to be an Eighth in a ſucceſſive order of Kings. For that ſhows him to be a King

                     <p>And the eighth King is called <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> and is one of thoſe ſeven Kings; which denotes the relation of the ſeven Kings to the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore every one of thoſe eight Kings muſt be one of the ſeven Heads, that are ſaid to be the ſeven Kings; becauſe every one of the eight Kings (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 4.) is one of thoſe ſame ſeven Kings, who are ſaid to be the ſeven Heads.</p>
                     <p>The fear of this Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That then the ſeventh King muſt be the ſeventh Head, is the chief ground of that Opinion before mentioned, that would have the Seventh King in the Order to be none of thoſe ſeven Kings, which are juſt before called the ſeven Kings in General, tho immediately after the mention of the whole ſeven in General, follows the account of them in order; and in that order the ſeventh King has its proper place. But they will have the eighth King to be the ſeventh Head of the Beaſt, which will appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Corollary</hi> to be inconſiſtent with the plain expreſſions of the Text.</p>
                     <q>The Eighth King is one of the Seven Heads of the Beaſt, that was <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Corollar. </seg>1</label> paſt, and revived again.</q>
                     <p>For the Eighth King was one of the Seven Kings that was paſt, and was returned into Power again by <hi>Coroll. Prop.</hi> 4. And all thoſe ſeven Kings reckoned up as paſt before him, have been
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204884:51"/> found to be ſo many Heads of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 5.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eighth King muſt be one of thoſe paſt ſeven Heads that was revived again, ſince the eighth King was one of thoſe ſeven Heads (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 5.) And yet came after the time of them all: And therefore muſt be one of them revived again.</p>
                     <p>This is ſo far agreed to by thoſe who make the eighth King the ſeventh Head, That they apprehend it to be the ſixth Head healed of a deadly wound: But it is manifeſt, That by this, they make but ſix Heads upon <hi>the Beaſt</hi> inſtead of ſeven. For the Head of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> that was ſeen wounded to death, and healed again in the <hi>13th Chap. v.</hi> 3. could be but one and the ſame Head. It is abſurd to make an Head wounded, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, to be more than one Head: And therefore does the Prophet deſcribe it but as one and the ſame Head. Wherefore ſince the maintainers of this Opinion do account the ſixth King of the ſeven to be the ſixth Head, and the ſeventh King to be no Head, the eighth King, which is but the healing of the ſixth Head, cannot encreaſe the number; and ſo they come at laſt to make but ſix Heads in all: For their ſeventh Head, is but the ſixth healed again, whereas there were ſeven really diſtinct Heads ſeen in the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>By the preceding <hi>Corollary</hi> it appears, That</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>The Eighth King, called</hi> The Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>ſignifies</hi> The Beaſt <label type="milestone">

                        <hi>with that Head only which was laſt in Rule.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the eighth King is one of the ſeven Heads of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> that was paſt, and revived again (by <hi>Corol. Prop.</hi> 5.) and was the eighth after the ſeven; and therefore muſt be that Head of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> that was laſt in Rule.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore ſince the eighth King is called <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and yet is found really to be but one Head of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> That term of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> can ſignify nothing, but <hi>the Beaſt</hi> with that particular Head only. And ſo the Head is ſaid to be <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> as the actions of Kings, are ſaid to be the Actions of that People, or Nation, where they Reign.</p>
                     <p>This Interpretation is confirmed by the agreement of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Interpreters of all differing Parties, excepting one or two, without any Reaſon for their diſſent, but only the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of a particular Opinion; and amongſt thoſe is that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204884:52"/> Opinion of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> who would have the number <hi>Seven</hi> in this place to ſignifie collectively <hi>All the Emperours,</hi> becauſe that Seven is very uſually taken in Scripture for a perfect number, <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Pontif. c. 5.</note> and then ſignifies <hi>All</hi> indefinitely, but more frequently in the <hi>Revelations</hi> than any where elſe: And yet all that know any thing of the difference betwixt the uſe of Seven when it is a perfect number, and when it is a broken number, cannot but ſee, that Seven here muſt neceſſarily be taken for a definite, determinate number, by the plain diſtribution of it into <hi>Five, One, Another,</hi> and an <hi>Eighth</hi> which was one of the Seven; And this is ſo common and known a thing, that there could not have been a plainer inſtance of the extravagancy of a Learned Man's imaginations about the moſt clear and known things.</p>
                     <p>And yet after all, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is ſo far of Opinion with the reſt, as to affirm, That Antichriſt, or <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> is the laſt King of thoſe who ſhall rule the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Pontif. c.</hi> 15. Which is an agreement with the reſt in the preceding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
                     <p>From the former Corollary, it does very immediately follow,</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>That</hi> the Beaſt, <hi>all over the 17th Chapter of the</hi> Revelations, <note place="margin">Prop. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>does ſignifie</hi> the Beaſt <hi>with his laſt Ruling Head.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>For <hi>the Beaſt</hi> all over the 17th Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that ſtate of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in which he was ſeen in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe, as does thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:</p>
                     <p>After that ſhow of him, he is called all over that Chapter by the name of <hi>THE Beaſt,</hi> in reference to his having been ſeen before; which, in common uſe of Speech, determines him to be the ſame that had been there ſhewn; and therefore, by <hi>Rule</hi> 1. he muſt be all over the Chapter <hi>the Beaſt</hi> that was ſeen in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe.</p>
                     <p>Now of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> which was there ſeen, the Angel ſays, v. 8. That <hi>He was, and is not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>the Beaſt, which was, and is not,</hi> he ſays at the 11th verſe, was the <hi>eighth King,</hi> who is known to be <hi>the Beaſt</hi> with the laſt Ruling Head, <hi>(Coroll.</hi> 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> 5.) <hi>The Beaſt</hi> therefore does ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing elſe all over the 17th Chap. <hi>Revel.</hi> but the ſtate of it under its laſt Ruling Head.</p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:204884:52"/>
                     <p> And tho' there were <hi>Seven Heads</hi> ſeen upon <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> yet it is expreſly ſaid, That all the other Heads would be paſt before the Reign of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>eighth King,</hi> v. 10. So that the ſight of him with the Seven Heads, was in effect the ſeeing him with Six dead Heads, and <hi>One</hi> of the Seven only revived again; which is the ſame with the ſight of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> under its <hi>one laſt Ruling Head only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See then the ſum of this Proof in ſhort: <hi>The Beaſt</hi> all over the 17th Chapter, is <hi>the Beaſt that was ſeen,</hi> v. 3. <hi>The Beaſt</hi> that was there ſeen, had the peculiar Character of, <hi>Was, and is not;</hi> and <hi>the Beaſt that was, and is not,</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>eighth King;</hi> and the <hi>eighth King</hi> has been found to ſignifie nothing but <hi>the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Corol. 2. Prop. 5.</note>

                     <p>Beſides, ſince the myſtical meaning of the term of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> is ſaid in one place to be the <hi>eighth King,</hi> that is, <hi>The Beaſt</hi> under the laſt Ruling Head, by <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. it muſt have the ſame ſignification all over the Chapter, by <hi>Rule</hi> 3.<hi>—Babylon</hi> might as well ſignifie two ſeveral Cities in two different places of that Chapter, as <hi>the Beaſt</hi> ſeveral Kings.</p>

                     <p>And the <hi>Woman,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> is repreſented riding upon it at that time in great Majeſty, and known to ſignifie <hi>Rome</hi> in its Idolatrous Antichriſtian Reign, <hi>Prop.</hi> 1.

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Manifeſt Grounds for a ſtrong preſumption, That the Term of</hi> The Beaſt <hi>does ſignifie the ſame particular ſtate of</hi> the Beaſt, <hi>all over the</hi> Revelations. <hi>The mentions of it in the 13th and 17th Chapters every way parallel.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FOR a more full and determinate knowledge of the Nature and Characters of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> ſo often mentioned in theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it is very neceſſary to examine, Whether every ſhew of it be one and the ſame ſtate of <hi>the Beaſt?</hi> For without ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that, all our knowledge of this kind will be confined to the bounds of the 17th Chapter.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that by <hi>Rule</hi> 3. the Term of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> being the ſame peculiar myſtical expreſſion, there is great reaſon to judge, That it ſignifies every-where the ſame thing. But there ſeems to be plain grounds given us to ſuſpect the contrary; for there are ſeveral different ſhews of it, as if it were purpoſely deſigned to warn us thereby, that they were ſo many new ſtates of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> according to the variety of the ſucceſſions of his Heads. Wherefore, in ſearch of a more large and comprehenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in the 17th Chapter, one would be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous to find, that every mention of the ſame Term in all the other Chapters, did really ſignifie the ſame thing: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhould have a great many more Properties and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to judge of him, and to determine his particular ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The more Marks that one has of a Beaſt, the more eaſie will it be to find him, and to diſtinguiſh him from all others that may reſemble him.</p>
                     <p>The places where it would be judged to be the moſt likely to find the Term of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> to ſignifie the ſame thing with <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in the 17th Chapter, are the Chapters juſt <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the 17th; and to them are we therefore directed for our firſt beginning in this ſearch.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, The mention of <hi>the Beaſt, after</hi> the 17th Chapter, would be concluded could be nothing elſe but the continuation of the Hiſtory of <hi>the ſame Beaſt</hi> that is mentioned <hi>in</hi> the 17th
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:204884:54"/> Chapter: for we find no mention made of <hi>any other Beaſt,</hi> or of any <hi>new ſhew of a Beaſt,</hi> betwixt the 17th Chapter and the 19th, where we ſee <hi>the Beaſt</hi> brought upon the Stage again: And who would not thereupon conclude, That <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in the 19th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with that Note of reference before it, did certainly ſignifie <hi>the Beaſt</hi> that had been laſt diſcourſed of in the 17th Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it? And therefore is this unanimouſly agreed on amongſt all Interpreters, That it is <hi>the ſame Beaſt</hi> in both places, as to the <hi>general Notion</hi> of <hi>the Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in that ſenſe alſo is it granted to be <hi>the ſame Beaſt</hi> in the Chapters <hi>before</hi> the 17th: For it does indeed neceſſarily follow from the former; becauſe <hi>the Beaſt</hi> before the 17th, muſt be the ſame with <hi>that</hi> after it; for they have both the ſame peculiar Attendants, <hi>the falſe Prophet,</hi> with the <hi>Image of the Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>the Mark</hi> of it. And therefore does <hi>Grotius,</hi> with one or two more, give general and comprehenſive Notions of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. which are the ſame in all kind of ſtates of <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> and the one he calls <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the other <hi>Magick;</hi> but withal, applies theſe <hi>general</hi> Notions to very different things <hi>in particular,</hi> in thoſe ſeveral mentions of the Beaſt <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the 17th Chapter. So that, in effect, he ſtill makes <hi>the Beaſt</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> in one place, quite different things <hi>in particular,</hi> than they are in the other; and <hi>the Beaſt in the 17th Chapter,</hi> to be as different a thing from either of them: He would have theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mentions of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> to be ſo many ſeveral ſtates of it; <hi>ſometimes</hi> under <hi>Ten Kings</hi> and <hi>Seven Emperours,</hi> ſignified by ſo many <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Horns;</hi> ſometimes to be but <hi>One Emperour,</hi> and then to be <hi>the Beaſt</hi> with <hi>One Head</hi> only; and <hi>ſometimes</hi> to be <hi>the Beaſt</hi> with <hi>Ten Horns</hi> only, without any of its <hi>Seven Heads.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſince there is little reaſon given for the proof of this, but only the divers ſhews of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> it muſt be very hard for any that is the leaſt impartial to ſhut his eyes againſt ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of an exact likeneſs and uniformity, in very particular Characters, in each of the ſeveral mentions of theſe Beaſts, that would ſtrongly perſuade a man, that it was impoſſible but that they ſhould ſignifie <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame particular</hi> ſtate of one and the ſame Beaſt. Eſpecially, when he conſiders, That the Angel did very manifeſtly intend that theſe Viſions ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and after ſuch a manner as the generality of the World would conclude from the expreſſions in them, where there is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204884:55"/> any plain ground for it. For example, It has been already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <note place="margin">Rev. XIII. &amp; XVII.</note> That the term of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> muſt ſignify the ſame thing at leaſt <hi>in general, before, in,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the 17th Chapter. And in every of thoſe Places he is certainly in a <hi>particular</hi> ſtate, by the <note place="margin">Pag. praeced.</note> particular Actions, and Characters, that are given him. Now would any one queſtion whether <hi>the Beaſt</hi> were in one particular ſtate of his Heads and Horns in theſe ſeveral places, when there are theſe particular Circumſtances and Characters that follow, which are the ſame in each particular deſcription?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As they are in the 13th and 17th Chapters both deſcribed with ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, ſo are they alſo characterized more peculiarly by one Head only of the ſeven. <hi>The one</hi> by his <note place="margin">Chap. 13. 3. Chap. 17. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>healed Head,</hi> and the <hi>Mouth</hi> of it; <hi>The other</hi> by the <hi>8th King,</hi> or Head, which was one of the ſeven Heads.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The peculiar Head that the one is deſcribed by, is an <hi>Head</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>wounded to death,</hi> and healed again; and under which <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> with the ſame Falſe Prophet that he is found with in the 13th Chapter, does in all appearance come to his end; and that Head therefore muſt be is Laſt Head; and yet it cannot be diſtinct from the other Seven, becauſe it is but one of them healed, and it comes after them all, as the laſt of all, and ſo muſt neceſſarily be an Eighth, which was one of the Seven.</p>
                     <p>Now the Head of the other is expreſly ſaid to be an <hi>Eighth, which was one of the Seven.</hi>

                     <p>To make them then ſignify two different ſtates of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> (or of <hi>Roman</hi> Rule, as <hi>the Beaſt</hi> is here agreed to ſignify) there muſt at leaſt theſe unlikelihoods be digeſted, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That all theſe Characters together, which are the ſame in both, muſt be twice verified of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, <hi>viz.</hi> That it had <hi>twice</hi> a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Government over it, which came after Seven before it, and yet was one of the Seven; and Ten Kings <hi>twice</hi> confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with ſuch a Power at <hi>two</hi> ſeveral Changes of <hi>Roman</hi> Power, in <hi>two</hi> ſeveral ſtates of the ſame kind of Idolatry, and Antichriſtian Tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>Rome</hi> muſt have <hi>two</hi> eminent Ruines in the midſt of all theſe ſame Circumſtances <hi>twice</hi> repeated: For theſe, and many other very peculiar Characters muſt have been all at a time <hi>in conjunction,</hi> or have belonged alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the ſame time to each of theſe ſame repeated States of <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> Which would have been much like a Story of the throwing ſo many Dice out of a Box at <hi>two</hi> ſeveral times into juſt the ſame Order and Chances without any contrivance.

                     <p>After all this particular Examination, If we would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ordinary proof, and ſuch as makes men ſure of almoſt all other places of Scripture; that is, what the Context does, as it were of its own accord force one to be confident of; The Conſideration of the Hiſtories of theſe <hi>Two Beaſts,</hi> and of their order and dependance upon one another, would appear to be a ſufficient ground for a full conviction of the certainty of this Truth.</p>
                     <p>For it is very obvious to obſerve, That the 17th Chapter comes in about the concluſion of the Hiſtory of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> of the 13th Chapter, for nothing, but to tell the Prophet, (as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Angel himſelf does ſeem to intimate) what was meant <hi>by the Beaſt,</hi> and his <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> and <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> and by <hi>Great Babylon,</hi> which had been the Subject of all the four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before it.</p>
                     <p>To ſecure us in this Perſuaſion, we ſee that the buſineſs of the 17th Chapter is brought in immediately after the 16th by one of thoſe Seven Angels, with the Seven Vials, who had been juſt before employed about the Seven laſt Plagues that were poured out upon the other <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the former Chapter: And the Introduction to all that this Angel had to communicate in the 17th Chapter, is an offer from him to ſhew the Apoſtle the Judgment of that <hi>Great Whore,</hi> called <hi>Babylon the Great,</hi> which had been juſt mentioned before by that very name of <hi>Babylon the Great</hi> in the Hiſtory of the other <hi>Beaſt</hi> at the end of the 16th Chapter. And then again, after the interpoſing of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the 17th Chapter, comes in the continuation of the Hiſtory of the ſame <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Beaſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:204884:56"/> that had been broken off at the end of the 16th Chapter, and is carried on to the laſt end of them both in the 18th and 19th Chapters.</p>
                     <p>This does very plainly ſhew, That the 17th Chapter comes in only to interpret thoſe Myſtical Expreſſions in the Chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, by a new Repreſentation of the ſame <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and of the ſame <hi>Babylon,</hi> that had been the great Subject juſt before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of.</p>
                     <p>Now it is already aſſured, That <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the 17th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſignifies but <hi>one particular ſtate</hi> of it under its laſt Ruling Head, <hi>Prop.</hi> 6.—And therefore if it be the ſame with that mentioned in the other Chapter, that <hi>Beaſt</hi> alſo muſt be the ſame particular ſtate of it under its laſt Head.</p>
                     <p>To ſecure us alſo ſtill further in the aſſurance of this, there is <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Evidence that has been inſiſted upon in the former Chapter, is of the nature of that accumulative proof, which in Courts of Judicature does determine the beſt and wiſeſt men about the neareſt Intereſts of men in this World. But notwithſtanding ſo ſtrange a concurrence of ſuch peculiar Circumſtances in <hi>the Beaſt</hi> of the 13th and 17 Chapters, yet <hi>Grotius</hi> does make them to be very diſtinct ſtates of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and therefore it will be requiſite to ſearch for a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and convincing proof, That they muſt both neceſſarily be the ſame particular ſtate of one only of the Heads of <hi>the Beaſt.</hi> The Conſequence of miſtaking in this ſearch being no leſs than the falling into confuſions about the firſt grounds of all clear knowledge of theſe things, which would multiply into infinite Errors in the reaſoning upon them: It is therefore neceſſary to uſe the greateſt circumſpection in it, and to advance in it but by ſuch ſhort ſteps, as we may clearly ſee, that we tread firm and ſure in all the way towards it. And in this Deſign, that which is firſt to be cleared, is, That</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>The Term of</hi> The Beaſt <hi>all over the 13th Chapter does ſignify</hi>

                        <hi>only the</hi> Firſt Beaſt <hi>ſhown,</hi> v. 1.</q>
                     <p>This ſeems to be ſufficiently evident. For there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other <hi>Beaſt</hi> beſides in that Chapter, but of the <hi>Second Beaſt;</hi> and that it cannot ſignify the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the firſt mention of that <hi>Beaſt</hi> there, may thus be ſhewn in order.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:204884:57"/> 1. That it ſignifies nothing elſe <hi>before the mention</hi> of that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is agreed by all; becauſe there is no other <hi>Beaſt</hi> before that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> that it can ſignify: And <hi>four</hi> times is it ſo called by the name of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> without any other addition; and <hi>twice</hi> is it ſaid, that <hi>all the World,</hi> or the Earth, did <hi>worſhip</hi> him, before the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Second Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And that the Term of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> does ſignify the <hi>Firſt Beaſt</hi> alſo <hi>after the mention of the Second,</hi> is certain enough. For though thrice after the riſe of the <hi>Second Beaſt,</hi> the Firſt has a note of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction added to the Term of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> As <hi>The Firſt Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>The Beaſt that was deadly wounded,</hi> &amp;c. yet when that Term has no note of diſtinction added to it, it does alſo ſignify the <hi>Firſt Beaſt,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Second:</hi> So v. 14. where it is ſaid of the <hi>Second Beaſt,</hi> that he had power to do Miracles in the ſight of <hi>The Beaſt;</hi> it is unqueſtionable that by <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> is meant the <hi>Firſt Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ſame manner is the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> brought in after, as employed about the Affairs of the <hi>Firſt Beaſt,</hi> to the end of the Chapter; Where it is diſtinguiſhed from the ſeveral mentions of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> by the name of <hi>He,</hi> as the Agent about ſomething <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that has the term of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> joined with it. For example, <hi>He</hi> gave life to the Image of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> which in the Verſe before <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> was ſaid to be the Image made to the <hi>Firſt Beaſt; He</hi> made all men receive the Mark, and Name, and Number of the name of <hi>the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Beaſt:</hi> Which <hi>Beaſt</hi> all the World would underſtand in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſpeech to ſignify a <hi>Beaſt</hi> different from <hi>him,</hi> who did all theſe things about the Affairs of <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when it is found that this term of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> had <hi>four</hi> times <note place="margin">Chap. 13. v. 2, 3, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>before</hi> the mention of the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> in the ſame Chapter been uſed to ſignify the <hi>Firſt Beaſt</hi> and <hi>once</hi> at leaſt <hi>after</hi> the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> without any diſpute about it; and had <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> been often mentioned after the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> with ſome other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to it: And yet the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> had never been clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by the name of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> after the firſt mention of its <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> riſe; but in every Verſe after that, is ſignified in the Original <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> only by a Verb in the Third Perſon, as acting in the Affairs of that which is called <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> which muſt therefore certainly be ſome other <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is referred to by that Article of reference, as diſtinct from him, and as <hi>before</hi> known, and mentioned.

                     </q>
                     <p>The neceſſity of this does appear from their being the ſame very peculiar Expreſſions in thoſe Chapters, that they are in the 13th Chapter; and therefore by <hi>Rule the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> muſt ſignify the ſame <hi>Firſt Beaſt,</hi> and his Adjuncts, unleſs there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more clear againſt it.</p>
                     <p>But the grounds upon which a very worthy Perſon thinks <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> p. 524. &amp; p. 708.</note> otherwiſe, are far from being more clear. As</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Second Beaſt</hi> ought to be ſome-where mentioned in theſe Chapters by the name of <hi>The Beaſt.</hi> For is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <label type="milestone">

                     </p>
                     <p>Nor <hi>2dly,</hi> is it any thing ſo clear, That the Image of <hi>the</hi>

                        <hi>Beaſt,</hi> is the ſame with the <hi>Firſt Beaſt;</hi> and that therefore in the mentions of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and the Image of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> both together, by <hi>The Beaſt</hi> muſt be underſtood the <hi>Second Beaſt,</hi> or elſe there muſt be a tautology, as he would have it. For there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that the Image and the <hi>Firſt Beaſt</hi> are the ſame thing. On the contrary, The Image of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> in the very expreſſion of it, does ſignify another thing <hi>different</hi> from <hi>the Beaſt</hi> it ſelf, or ſome other thing that is <hi>only like</hi> the <hi>Firſt Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what ſmall Reaſons are theſe to alledge againſt the ſo frequent and conſtant uſe of the Term of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> to ſignify the <hi>Firſt Beaſt</hi> in the Chapter where theſe peculiar Characters of it are found with it; and where alſo it is granted by the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:204884:58"/> Perſon, that the Image of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> does really ſignify the Image of <hi>the Firſt Beaſt?</hi> The known and frequent uſe of any peculiar Expreſſions, is the Rule that all Judicious Perſons recommend for the interpreting any other places of Scripture; and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's Example in his Interpretation of part of theſe Viſions, does ſtill further confirm it to be the Right Rule for theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore for the future, to avoid all unneceſſary multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of words, I will make uſe of only the term of <hi>The Beaſt in,</hi> or <hi>of</hi> the 13th Chapter, to ſignify any mention of the <hi>Firſt Beaſt</hi> from that Chapter, either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the 17th Chapter; becauſe in thoſe Chapters, <hi>The Beaſt</hi> is every-where joined with the forementioned Attendants.</p>
                     <p>It will not be now very difficult from the former <hi>Corollaries</hi> to find, that <hi>The Beaſt</hi> from the 13th Chapter, to the end of the mention of that Term in theſe Viſions, as well <hi>in the 17th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as <hi>in the reſt,</hi> is one and the ſame particular ſtate of its Laſt Ruling Head: In order to which, it muſt be firſt advanced, That</p>
                     <q>The Beaſt <hi>in the 13th Chapter ſignifies</hi> a particular ſtate <hi>of</hi> the <note place="margin">Propoſit. 9.</note> Beaſt <hi>under one of its either Ruling Heads or Horns, in all the time of its continuance.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>The certainty of this is the moſt neceſſary to be in the firſt place ſecured, becauſe the way that others take to confound all the Significations of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in the ſeveral mentions of that Term, and to keep them from any particular determinate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which they might be concluded to be the ſame parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing, is, To underſtand the Term of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> every-where in <hi>a general</hi> notion, which may be allowed to be every-where the ſame; and yet the things with which it is joined, may ſhew it to be meant of quite <hi>different</hi> ſtates of <hi>the Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that this <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the 13th Chapter, is in a <hi>particular</hi> ſtate of one of its Heads, or Horns, does thus appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the 13th Chapter has a ſet time of continuance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpace of 42 months, as the Original is <note place="margin">v. 5.</note> agreed to ſignify.</p>
                     <p>And it is deſcribed as continuing for that time, with a very <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> haughty commanding <hi>Mouth.</hi> The <hi>Mouth</hi> is joined with the <hi>time</hi> of his continuance, and is mentioned again in the next words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204884:59"/> it; and he is deſcribed with that Mouth at his firſt riſe alſo as his peculiar Character; and in all thoſe three places it is ſet out as an over-ruling, uncontrolable Mouth.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch a <hi>Mouth</hi> muſt ſignify ſome <hi>particular</hi> Ruling Power, <note place="margin">v. 2.</note> when joined with <hi>a Beaſt</hi> that is ſaid to have ſo Univerſal a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: and for this particular Rule, of ſome ſuch particular Power, for all the time of the continuance of the 42 Months of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> we have the general conſent of all thoſe of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters that are the moſt concerned againſt this Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Mouth</hi> that is ſaid to be the Mouth of a Beaſt with Heads and Horns, as it is here, and that ſo very remarkable a <hi>Mouth,</hi> muſt belong either to one of the Heads, or to one of the Horns; as there is much the ſame deſcription of the Mouth of the little Horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 7. And an Head, or Horn of a Beaſt, that repreſents Dominion, as it does here, does every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in Prophecy ſignify a <hi>Ruling</hi> Head, or Horn; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ſuch a commanding Mouth added to it, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſignify a very particular commanding Head, or Horn, <hi>by Rule</hi> 2. unleſs it could be made more clear, that it is the Mouth of ſuch a Head, as ſignifies one of the <hi>Seven Hills,</hi> which is not pretended by any, and ſeems to be almoſt abſurd but to mention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Beaſt</hi> therefore with that Mouth, for all the time of his continuance, muſt be in the particular ſtate of that Head, or Horn.</p>
                     <p>And if <hi>the Beaſt</hi> be in the particular ſtate of any Ruling Head, or Horn, then by the Term of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> for all the time of his continuance, muſt be underſtood at every mention of it, <hi>The Beaſt</hi> with that particular Head or Horn. For ſo is the Term of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> generally uſed to ſignify in Prophecy, when it is in any particular ſtate of Heads or Horns. So all over the 17th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Revelations</hi> ſeveral times <hi>(Prop.</hi> 6.)—ſo alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7, 8. and ſo therefore <hi>(by Rule the</hi> 2<hi>d)</hi> muſt it be here for <hi>all</hi> the time of its continuance in that ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, that <hi>this Beaſt</hi> in the 13th Chapter is deſcribed all over the Chapter by <hi>one</hi> of its Heads wounded to death, and healed. And <hi>A Beaſt</hi> with one, or more of its Heads at a time, does every-where in Prophecy ſignify that <hi>Beaſt</hi> with that, or thoſe particular Ruling Powers at that time, even by the conſent of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:204884:59"/> thoſe who are moſt difficult in theſe things; and the particular time is the 42 Months of his continuance. And therefore to whatſoever the Mouth of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> belongs, <hi>the Beaſt</hi> there muſt be in a particular ſtate of one of its Heads, <hi>by Rule</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew the uſe of the term of <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mention of his Head, to ſignify the ſame <hi>particular</hi> ſtate of it under that Head; That which is called <hi>The Beaſt</hi> with <note place="margin">v. 3.</note> the Head <hi>wounded to death,</hi> and <hi>healed</hi> in <hi>one</hi> place, is in the <hi>other</hi> place of this Chapter called <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>deadly wound was</hi>

                        <hi>healed,</hi> and The Beaſt <hi>who had a wound by a Sword, and did live,</hi> without any mention of his Head, to which nevertheleſs that <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> Circumſtance does unqueſtionably refer; ſo that by the bare term of <hi>The Beaſt</hi> wounded and healed, is ſignified <hi>The Beaſt</hi> with that particular Head.</p>
                     <p>If any one would pretend after this, that the healed Head might ſignify one of the ſeven Hills (ſaid to be the Heads, Chap. 17. 9.) He muſt bring greater evidence for it <hi>by Rule the</hi> 2<hi>d,</hi> than the Prophetical uſe of an Head of <hi>a Beaſt</hi> for the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Power of it is; which is not pretended by any. All that appears for it is, that the ſeven Heads, which were crowned in the Dragon, chap. 12. have no Crowns upon <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in the 13th Chapter immediately after, which may ſeem to ſhew, that the Heads in the 13th Chapter without Crowns, are Hills.</p>
                     <p>But that would be a reaſon for making the ſeven Heads no Kings in the 17th Chapter alſo, where they are ſhown without <note place="margin">Chap. 17. 10.</note> Crowns, and yet are certainly ſo many Kings. But from the 17th Chapter it is plain, that the time of their Crowns would be paſt before <hi>The Beaſt</hi> would come to be in that ſtate, which he appears in in the 17th Chapter, and the 13th. For even according to <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, the ſeven Reigns would be paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of thoſe two Shows in each Chapter. And then was it not proper to repreſent thoſe ſeven Heads without Crowns, that is, as Kings ſeven of whoſe Reigns were paſt? for that in being was an 8th, that was after the 7th.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, Since the 17th Chapter, which is the only ground for making thoſe ſeven <hi>Heads</hi> in the 13th Chapter to ſignify the ſeven <hi>Hills,</hi> does alſo make them to be ſeven <hi>Kings;</hi> The only way to know whether of theſe two any Character of an Head does mean, is to conſider the nature of the Character, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the propriety of an Hill, or of a King. Now of which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:204884:60"/> of theſe two is it moſt proper to ſay, whether of an <hi>Hill,</hi> or of <hi>a King,</hi> that it was <hi>deadly wounded, and healed</hi> again? And with which of them, by reaſon of that wound, might <hi>the Beaſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (who is deſcribed with a very Royal Dominion) be moſt properly ſaid to be wounded, and to have his deadly wound healed; or to <hi>have a wound by a ſword, and yet to live?</hi> The very terms of the queſtion does ſhew, that this is properly ſaid of a <hi>King,</hi> who is the life of all the power of <hi>the Beaſt;</hi> but moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to be ſaid of the <hi>Hill</hi> of a City, to which a <hi>Beaſt</hi> may belong.</p>
                     <p>But whatſoever becomes of this wounded, and healed Head, we are aſſured by the <hi>mouth</hi> of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> that <hi>The Beaſt</hi> in the 13th Chapter, for the whole time of its continuance, does ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify <hi>The Beaſt in a particular ſtate of one</hi> of its Heads, or Horns.</p>

                     <p>WE have now ſufficient grounds to conclude, That</p>
                     <q>The ſeven Heads and ten Horns of the Beaſt in the 13th and <note place="margin">Propoſit. 10.</note> 17th Chapters, muſt ſignify the ſame things.</q>
                     <p>For ſince they are in both Chapters the ſame very peculiar, and proper myſtical Expreſſions; and ſince they are explained in the 17th Chapter, by <hi>Rule the third,</hi> they muſt ſignify the ſame things.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill further, to confirm the force of that <hi>Rule</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, and to make the thing unqueſtionable, it is to be conſidered, That The Beaſt of the 13th Chapter, is one and the ſame particular ſtate of it both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the 17th Chapter <hi>(by Coroll.</hi> 1, and 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> 9.) and ſo the 17th Chapter does ſtand in the body of the Hiſtory of that Beaſt of the 13th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We may alſo very plainly ſee, that the 17th Chapter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in that place only to explain the myſtical Significations of the ſame number of Heads and Horns upon a Beaſt to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance every way the ſame with this, and of that <hi>Babylon</hi> that is the common ſharer in the Fortunes of the Beaſt of the 13th Chapter, throughout all the account of him. For at the very <note place="margin">v. 1.</note> entrance into that Explication, it is ſaid by the Angel, that he would ſhew the Apoſtle the judgment of that <hi>Great Whore,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was but juſt before it, threatened with the Wrath of God in the Story of the other Beaſt at the concluſion of the 16th Chapter.</p>
                     <p>And then the Explication of this ſame kind, and number of things, of juſt ſo many Heads and Horns, as had been mentioned of the other Beaſt, is made by one of thoſe Angels with the ſeven Vials, who had been juſt before employed about the judgments of the former Beaſts all over the Chapter immediatly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204884:61"/> preceding this Explication. Who would not upon this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration conclude with himſelf, That the Angel's Explication of the ſame number of Heads and Horns in a new ſhow of a Beaſt, to all appearance the ſame with this other, whoſe Hiſtory is on purpoſe there interrupted to make room for that new ſhow, did moſt certainly refer to the ſame number of Heads and Horns of the Beaſt, which had all the way before been diſcourſed of? Eſpecially, when he ſees, that the Perſon that brings in all this new Scene, does expreſly ſay, that it was to tell the Apoſtle what that particular judgment of <hi>Babylon</hi> was, which had but juſt before been mentioned in the Hiſtory of the former Beaſt, and every-where made its companion; as alſo that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter <note place="margin">Chap. 16. v. 19.</note> himſelf had but juſt before been very buſie in the concerns of that Beaſt, which did but juſt conclude where this new ſhow began, and which alſo this Angel ſeems concerned to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, only to give this Explication of what had been already ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, unleſs it were very plainly inconſiſtent with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe more clearly known, which is not by any pretended; the ſeven Heads, and ten Horns of the Beaſts in the 13th and 17th Chapters, muſt by this new enforcement <hi>of Rule the third,</hi> moſt certainly ſignify the ſame things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcaſar</hi> does very well obſerve to this purpoſe upon the 1ſt Verſe of the 13th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations;</hi> The ſeven Heads and ten Horns of this Beaſt are the ſame with thoſe of the Beaſt in the 17th Chapter: which is ſo <hi>unqueſtionably clear,</hi> that they themſelves, who would have theſe two Beaſts to be different from one another, do yet agree, that the ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, have the ſame ſignification in both of theſe Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of which it muſt be inferred,</p>

                     </p>
                     <q>The Beaſt of the 13th Chapter is every way the ſame particular ſtate of <label type="milestone">

                     <p>For the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter, under every the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Head, or Horn, is the ſame particular Beaſt with that in the 17th Chapter in that ſame ſtate, by <hi>Coroll. praeced.</hi> And the Beaſt in the 17th Chapter, in the ſtate of its laſt Ruling Head, is deſtroy'd, (by <hi>Coroll.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 6.) Wherefore it muſt alſo be in the ſtate of its laſt Ruling Head, that the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter muſt be deſtroyed. Now the Beaſt of the 13th Chapter is deſtroy'd <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. 18. where it is the ſame particular ſtate of it, that it is in the 13th Chapter, (by <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> 9.)—That particular ſtate then, that the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter is in, is the ſtate of it under its laſt Head; that is, the ſame with that of the Beaſt in the 17th Chapter, by <hi>Prop.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>And that the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter, is in this ſame ſtate with that in the 17th Chapter, for the <hi>whole time of its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> is confirmed by <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. For it is, for its whole time, in that one and the ſame particular ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the time of the Beaſt, under any one of his Heads, is the <hi>whole time</hi> of that Head; the Beaſt and his Head make but one <hi>whole</hi> thing all that time; and this cannot be any time apart from one another, without ceaſing to be <hi>that</hi> Head in Rule, or <hi>that</hi> Beaſt: Wherefore the two Beaſts in the 13th and 17th Chapters being found to be one and the ſame Beaſt under its laſt Ruling Head, they muſt be the ſame for their <hi>whole time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if we conſult the Characters of both of them in their ſeveral Chapters, they will be found to <hi>begin</hi> both in the ſame particular circumſtances of the laſt Head, as well as to <hi>end</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>For the One <hi>begins</hi> at his <hi>riſing out of the Sea,</hi> Chap. 13. 1.</p>
                     <p>The Other, at his <hi>aſcent out of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> (Chap. 17. 8.) which is ſignified in the Original by the ſame name of the <hi>Abyſs,</hi> which is known to be the uſual word for the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>One</hi> riſes up with an Head wounded and healed, and yet the laſt Head, ch. 13. 1. &amp; ch. 19. 20.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>One</hi> riſes up with Ten Kings crowned upon him, ch. 13. 1.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Other</hi> with the ſame Ten Kings receiving Power with him, ch. 17. 12.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, the Beaſts in the 13th and 17th Chapters do <hi>begin</hi> together, and <hi>end</hi> together, in the ſame ſtate of their laſt Ruling Head of the Seven; and therefore are the ſame particular ſtate of the Beaſt in both Chapters for the whole time of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>
                     <p>We have then now both a cloſe and a demonſtrative proof, from the Proprieties of theſe two Beaſts, That they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be one and the ſame thing; and a copious variety alſo of very peculiar Circumſtances exactly the ſame in both, (as has been formerly more fully ſhewn), to ſecure and confirm it. It has been alſo obſerved, That the very Order and Dependance of the Accounts of theſe two Beaſts upon one another, as they ſeem to break into the continued relation of one anothers fortunes, would at the firſt ſight ſatisfie any impartial perſon of the ſame thing, without any farther ſcrupulous Examination. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it is confirmed by the <hi>almoſt unanimous</hi> Conſent of <hi>all kind of</hi>

                     <p>And thoſe two or three only, that have of late differed from the <hi>general</hi> current of the reſt in all Ages, do not pretend to give any other reaſon for it, than that the Beaſts in thoſe two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are two ſeveral ſhows, and therefore muſt be two different ſtates of the Beaſt: And how ſmall a ground is that, againſt ſo great a variety of convincing Evidences, and ſo univerſal an Authority?</p>
                     <p>There are indeed ſuch a variety of Circumſtances to make this Concluſion to appear unqueſtionable at the firſt curſory view of the Text, that it will appear to moſt perſons to have been too tedious and unneceſſary a trouble, which has been here taken to ſecure it.</p>
                     <p>But the great uſe of the Certainty of this Propoſition, will juſtifie the care that has been taken to aſſure it; for <hi>without it,</hi> the whole Prophecy will be found to be but a Rope of Sand, as it has alſo been made to be by thoſe who have been of another
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204884:62"/> Opinion in this Point: but by the Certainty of it, the whole Prophecy is found to be all of one piece, and about the ſame ſtate of things, tho' delivered in ſeveral Viſions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are we furniſhed with a greater variety of Circumſtances, to determine the nature of that which is the great Affair in them all.</p>
                     <p>From hence then it does now appear, That the wounded and healed Head in the 13th Chapter, is ſo far from being one of the ſeven Hills of <hi>Rome,</hi> that</p>
                     <q>The wounded and healed Head of the Beaſt, in the 13th Chapter, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Coroll. </seg>3</label> is the ſame laſt Ruling Head of the Beaſt with that in the 17th Chapter.</q>
                     <p>For the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter, is under the ſame laſt Ruling Head with that in the 17th Chapter, <hi>(Coroll. praeced.</hi> &amp; <hi>Prop.</hi> 9.) And the laſt Ruling Head of the Beaſt in the 17th Chapter, called, <hi>The eighth King,</hi> was an Head that had been one of thoſe ſeven that were paſt, and gone before it, and was now revived again, (by <hi>Coroll.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 5.) Which is the ſame with A laſt Ruling Head of Seven, which was wounded to death, and healed again. The Beaſt therefore in the 13th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is certainly in the ſtate of an Head wounded to death, and healed again. After the certainty of which, it will be a very extravagant thing to queſtion, Whether the wounded and healed Head, which the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter is under, be that wounded and healed Head which it is ſaid in the Text to have?</p>

Wherefore, to make the phraſe of <hi>Judging the Dead</hi> to ſignifie here, as ſome do, only the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the Cauſe of the Dead,</hi> is to change the ſignification of a very peculiar and generally-known expreſſion, into a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204884:63"/> acceptation of it; and to do that, without ſome great neceſſity for it, (for which there is here no apparent evidence pretended) is the way to licenſe men to allegorize all the Articles of our Belief away.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, this acceptation of <hi>Judging the Dead</hi> for the avenging them, is beyond all example. <hi>Judging</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> in general are, indeed, ambiguouſly uſed in Scripture: but <hi>Judging the Dead</hi> is never any where made uſe of, but to ſignifie the Judgment at Chriſt's ſecond Coming; and ſo was it always taken by the Chriſtian Church in all Ages, and ſo conveyed down by them in the ſame words in all the Ancient Creeds for ſeveral Ages, and joined with the mention of Chriſt's ſecond Coming. So that of all the ſhifts that <hi>Grotius</hi> is put to, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Interpretation, there ſeems none to be more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, or that does more ſhew his reſolution to cut all the Knots that he cannot unty, than this miſerable ſhift of making the <hi>Judging of the Dead</hi> here, to ſignifie the <hi>Revenging of the Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To aſſure one ſtill further of this, it appears to be the ſame phraſe, by which it is granted, that the <hi>real</hi> Judging of the Dead is ſignified in theſe very Viſions, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. <note place="margin">See Grot. in 20 Apoc. v. 12.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo added in this 11th Chapter, v. 18. to make it more unqueſtionable,<hi>—That thou ſhouldſt give the reward to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and to them that fear thy Name, ſmall and great.</hi> Which ſhews, that it is <hi>a change of the ſtate of the Dead themſelves,</hi> by the reward that is given to their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and this can be nothing but their reward at the ſecond Coming of Chriſt to Judgment.</p>
                     <p>For betwixt Death and That, there is no other reward for the <hi>Prophets, and Saints, ſmall and great,</hi> at one time, as is here expreſſed;<hi>—The time of the Dead is come, that they ſhould be judged; and that thou ſhouldſt give the reward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>For firſt, it is joined with judging of the Dead at the 18th verſe: <hi>The time is come, that the Dead ſhould be judged;</hi> that is, The time is now come, <hi>now,</hi> that <hi>thou haſt taken to thee thy great</hi>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:204884:64"/> 
                        <hi>power, and haſt reigned,</hi> as juſt before it is expreſſed. That glorious Reign, and the Judging of the Dead, are very expreſly joined together in the ſame Doxology of the four and twenty Elders, and ſo ty'd to the ſame time, that if they be not contemporary, yet there is nothing comes in betwixt them: and therefore muſt that Reign of Chriſt be at leaſt <hi>at the ſame time</hi> with his Coming in Glory. And what can ſuch a glorious Kingdom of Chriſt be at that time, but his glorious Coming or Appearance? For ſince there is but <hi>one</hi> ſecond Coming of Chriſt to be expected, his glorious Reign and his ſecond Coming, fixed, as here, to one time, muſt certainly be the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>And that which ſecures them to be the ſame, without farther ground of ſcruple, is, That this Reign of Chriſt is ſaid to be Univerſal, <hi>over all the Kingdoms of this World;</hi> and alſo Eternal with his Father, <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> v. 15. Which can be nothing but his Kingdom of <hi>Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be objected, That Chriſt's Coming in Glory is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning only of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> Kingdom; whereas it is here ſaid, The Kingdoms of <hi>this</hi> World are become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Chriſt: It is to be conſidered, That the firſt ſhew of his Kingdom is <hi>agreed by all</hi> to be upon Earth at his Coming; and for the remaining part of it, it is here expreſſed to be for <hi>ever and ever;</hi> and ſo alſo a Kingdom in Heaven with his Father.</p>
                     <p>It may here be ſuggeſted, That this would make the Coming of Chriſt in Glory, and his Kingdom of Glory here upon <hi>Earth,</hi> to be but a momentary thing, only during the time of the Day of Judgment; whereas he is repreſented in ſeveral places as reigning here in Glory with his Saints for a conſiderable time after the end of Antichriſt. But Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has given this Anſwer to that, That according to the Notion of the <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> from whom the New Teſtament did bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it, it was taken <hi>for a continuance of time for</hi> 1000 <hi>years together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all that need be regarded for the preſent purpoſe in hand, is, That it is agreed by All Parties, That the beginning of the Judgment of the Dead, properly ſo called, is not till the ſecond Coming of Chriſt in Glory.</p>
                     <p>By this are we aſſured now at laſt, That</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>For firſt, This Beaſt in the 11th Chapter hath one of the moſt peculiar diſtinguiſhing Characters of that Beaſt; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſs pit;</hi> which is the very ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with that of the Beaſt in the 17th Chapter, v. 8. in juſt the ſame peculiar phraſe. And the ſame Character has that Beaſt in the 13th Chapter, in another different expreſſion indeed, but of the ſame ſignification; <hi>viz.</hi> That it did <hi>riſe out of the Sea;</hi> for the Sea is very ordinarily called in the <hi>Septuagint</hi> (which the <hi>Greek</hi> of the New Teſtament does generally conform to) by the ſame name of <hi>the Abyſs,</hi> which is here rendred the <hi>bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When therefore we ſee, in the Chapters after this 11th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the mention of a Beaſt that is to <hi>aſcend out of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> which is made his peculiar Character, to diſtinguiſh him from other ſtates of him under the ſucceſſion of his Heads; and that here there is the ſame peculiar deſcription of ſuch a Beaſt, with the name of <hi>THE Beaſt that aſcendeth,</hi> &amp;c. which plainly refers us to the ſame Character of a Beaſt ſomewhere elſe mentioned: It muſt certainly be the ſame with that Beaſt, or elſe there is no ground to believe a thing to be the ſame at two ſeveral mentions of it, tho' it has the ſame peculiar Character in both places, and a Note of reference in one of them to confine it to the ſame thing that had been before mentioned; which in this caſe would be a violation of all the firſt Three Rules, which have been judged to be the ſureſt ground for any Interrpetation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beſides, they both end at the expiration of the ſame ſpace of time of 42 months, or the 1260 days of the Witneſſes in Sackcloth; which is the ſame ſtate in both, becauſe it is the laſt ſtate of them both.</p>
                     <p>The Beaſt in the 11th Chapter is alſo deſcribed to end juſt before a glorious Reign of Chriſt, in the 7th Trumpet, which is accompanied with a Judgment of the Dead. So alſo does the Beaſt in the 19th Chapter come to an end juſt before a Reign of Chriſt, which is accompanied with the Judgment of the Dead, chap. 20.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:204884:65"/>
                     <p> And is not this a very good ground to be confident, that they are both the ſame Beaſt, when they are ſaid to end at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the ſame peculiar ſpace of time, and at the beginning of juſt the ſame kind of peculiar Reign of Chriſt over all the world, and for ever and ever, and that is accompanied with the Judgment of the Dead? For ſince they are thus found, from theſe Circumſtances, to be contemporary, how can a Beaſt with ſo peculiar Characters, that are the ſame in the other, and at the ſame time, be ſuppoſed to be quite another thing?</p>
                     <p>In both the mentions of the Beaſts, we alſo find them <hi>warring againſt the ſame Martyrs,</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of God, and Chriſt, and in both <hi>overcoming them,</hi> and <hi>being overcome</hi> by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>WE have now our proſpect very much enlarged, <note place="margin">Dan. VII.</note> by a multitude of known Marks of the Beaſt, which is found to be the ſame particular ſtate of one of its Heads from the firſt mention of him in Chap. 11. to the laſt end of his Hiſtory in Chapter 20. by which he is deſcribed to us in all his lineaments, with his Riſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:204884:67"/> his Mark, his Actions, and his End, and with a great many of his Aſſiſtants and Dependants. And, I think, I could make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable to any that were impartial and conſiderate enough, that one may come to a very ſatisfactory determination from hence about the particular knowledge of him.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe I would continue firm to my firſt deſign of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the proof all along in ſo full and convincing a manner, as ſhould be able to ſatisfie the moſt <hi>ſceptical</hi> ſcruples, it will be much more uſeful to conſult the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſignification of the myſtical Phraſes that are made uſe of all over theſe Viſions in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> for there is a great deal more evidence of the determinate ſignification of <hi>a Beaſt</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and of the Heads, and Horns, and Actions of a Beaſt in that Prophecy. There are a multitude of Inſtances there of the conſtant uſe of theſe figures in one and the ſame deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Notion; and it is generally agreed, That St. <hi>John,</hi> by the like expreſſions in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> does every-where allude to them, as the Original Copy of his Figures, and as a <hi>Nomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clator</hi> to explain the meaning of them. <hi>[See References in the 5th Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is alſo this further advantage in the Prophetical Uſages of the myſtical Expreſſions in <hi>Daniel,</hi> That there is the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of almoſt all Interpreters in the particular ſignification of them, who yet differ from one another about the ſignification of the ſame Expreſſions in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> And as I found this to be of very great effect for the ſilencing of mine own Scruples, ſo is it the moſt certainly ſatisfactory method for the generality of the World.</p>
                     <p>The Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> have indeed that advantage above <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> any other Myſtical Writings of that nature, that the things foretold in them, are ſo plainly deſcribed, That all who have conſidered them, have in all Ages, till this latter, generally agreed about their Interpretation; <hi>One or two Inſtances</hi> to the contrary in the ſpace of ſo many Ages will be no material ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt it by <hi>Rule the 4th.</hi>

                        <hi>Porphyrie the Philoſopher,</hi> who is the firſt that is ſaid to be of a different mind from the reſt, yet gives ſuch a reaſon for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the date and matter of theſe Propheſies to the times of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as does unqueſtionably confirm the clearneſs <note place="margin">S. <hi>Hierom.</hi> Prooem. in <hi>Dan.</hi>
                        </note> of his Expreſſions in all his Viſions. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> acquaints us, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:204884:67"/> his reaſon for it was, <q>Becauſe it ſeemed plain to him, That the Author muſt have lived about the times of <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> from the diſtinct Account he gives us in the 11th Chapter, of the Succeſſions and Actions of the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings under the names of the King of the <hi>North,</hi> and of the King of the <hi>South,</hi> till the time of <hi>Epiphanes.</hi> And ſo he will have it to be an Hiſtory of what is paſt, and not a Prophecy of things to come.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Could there be a greater Teſtimony of the clearneſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Expreſſions, than to ſee a profeſt Enemy to it, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be ſo very plain, that he could not believe it to be <note place="margin">

                     <p n="1">1. By our Saviour's owning the Prophecy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 15. Which to Chriſtians is an undeniable proof, though it could not be ſo to an Infidel.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who lived about the time of Chriſt (not two hundred years after <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes)</hi> does own the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> for the moſt conſiderable of any that they had; and relates of it, That it was ſhown to <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> by <hi>Jad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> the High-Prieſt, upon the account of the 8th Chapter, which did plainly foretel his Conqueſt of the <hi>Perſian;</hi> And that this was owned by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and rewarded with many great Privileges to the <hi>Jews,</hi> particularly that of being Tax-free every ſeventh year, which, no queſtion, remained to <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Age as the publick Memorial of that Action. What an unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Forgery would that be, which ſhould be able to impoſe ſo ſtrangely upon one of the moſt Learned Antiquaries in that Age, and make him take a Writing concerning his own Nation not Two hundred years old, for an Ancient Writing of Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſtanding?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Eſpecially, when we conſider, that it had been long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Canon of Scripture in <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s days, and had been conſtantly uſed in <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlations in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:204884:68"/> (as appears by our Saviour's Quotations) which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a forged Book, not much above One hundred years old, to have been.</p>
                     <p>After this aſſurance, <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s ſuſpicion that it was an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of things ſeen by the Writer of it, is as great a confirmation as can be deſired of the clearneſs of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s meaning in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Deſcriptions in ſome parts of his Viſions; And the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concurrence of almoſt all Interpreters about the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſenſe of the reſt, is proof enough of the plainneſs of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in all.</p>
                     <p>For what can give one a plainer ground to preſume that it is eaſie to arrive at a perfect knowledge of the ſignification of the Myſtical Schemes of a Prophecy, than firſt to ſee it accuſed by <hi>an Enemy</hi> of having been wrote after the things were done, <hi>only upon the account of the clearneſs</hi> of the terms that are uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them; And next, to ſee all Interpreters of the moſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parties and Intereſts unanimouſly agreed upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Application of them?</p>
                     <p>This is an encouragement ſufficient to make one hope for the fulleſt ſatisfaction from the Viſions of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſignification of the ſame Myſtical Terms in both Prophecies: In order to which, The firſt thing, that it is the moſt neceſſary to be reſolved about, as the general Baſis of all that is to follow, is this Propoſition.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is the Kingdom of our Jeſus,</hi> is as certain, as it is, that our Jeſus was the true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For there is no name of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> any-where ſo peculiarly owned by Chriſt, as this name of the Son of Man is all over the Goſpel. And as by the note of reference joined with it, it muſt refer to ſome uſe of that name in ſome places of the Old Teſtament, where it is before mentioned; ſo do we find St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. 30. what place of the Old Teſtament that is. For our Saviour does there join that name of his with the very <hi>ſame</hi> Circumſtances that it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204884:68"/> mentioned with here in <hi>Daniel.</hi> In that place of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in all the other Goſpels beſide in his Prophecy of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he calls it the <hi>coming of the Son of Man in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory,</hi> which is juſt the ſame with that in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> about the <hi>coming of the Son of Man in the clouds of Heaven, and his waving an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Kingdom given him</hi> at the time of that Judgment, when there were infinite multitudes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels attending.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt certain from our Saviour's Examination before the High-Prieſt, That it was the commonly received Opinion of all men in thoſe days, That the name of the <hi>Son of Man</hi> in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his appearance that are mentioned in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> was the <hi>peculiar</hi> name of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or of that eminent Chriſt, whoſe coming was the great expectation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, and was appropriated to him alone. For upon that ſolemn adjuration of the High-Prieſt to Jeſus, to tell him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were the Chriſt, which was <hi>the putting him to his Oath</hi> about it; the Anſwer which our Saviour gives to it, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe very words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> viz. The <hi>Son of Man that was to come in the clouds of Heaven,</hi> Together with the Circumſtance of <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 64, 65, 66.</note> 
                        <hi>ſitting on the right hand of the power of God;</hi> The ſame with his Being <hi>brough near to the Ancient of days, who was upon his Throne</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 10, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>with myriads of Angels about him:</hi> And this was ſo preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood for an Anſwer of his being the Chriſt, and ſo <hi>generally,</hi> that the High-Prieſt thereupon forthwith <hi>rent his cloaths,</hi> and cryed that he had ſpoken Blaſphemy; and <hi>all the reſt</hi> about him judged him to be worthy of death.</p>
                     <p>To me therefore it looks like an Infatuation in ſo underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon as <hi>Grotius,</hi> To make the Son of Man in this 7th of <note place="margin">Grot. in v. 13. cap. 7. Dan.</note> 
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> to ſignify nothing but the <hi>Roman People;</hi> when he himſelf in his Comment upon the very ſame Expreſſion, and joined with the ſame Circumſtances in the 24th of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> v. 30. had acknowledged it to be ſpoken of Chriſt: And on St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 26. 64. does expreſly ſay, that our Saviour's owning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there to be the Chriſt, does refer to the ſame way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it in this 7th of <hi>Daniel.</hi> And which is the moſt to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, This he does without giving any account of any neceſſity for it, from this or any other place, where it is uſed, but thinks it ſufficient, that in this new ſenſe it will uphold a new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. This is therefore another plain inſtance againſt how
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:204884:69"/> clear a Light <hi>Grotius</hi> is able to ſhut his eyes, to be conſtant to a new Invention, though againſt the unanimous agreement of all the World beſides, and even to the hazarding of the Crime of Blaſphemy. For a Crime of that nature was it judged to be by the whole Sanhedrim of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as has been juſt obſerved) to give the incommunicable name of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to any other, than to the true <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And the error of their Judgment was only the fixing of that Crime upon him, who was the <hi>True</hi> Chriſt, to whom it did really belong.</p>
                     <p>It does indeed by this ſeem to be a double Blaſphemy; firſt to take away the proper Character of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> from the True Chriſt: And next, To give it away to a thing, that neither he himſelf, nor any elſe, ever thought to be the Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>SINCE now it is undoubted, that the Kingdom of the Son of Man is ſome Kingdom of our Jeſus, The Characters of it will make appear what Kingdom of his it is; and from a view of them, it may be reſolved, That</p>

                     <p>One would eaſily be perſuaded of this at the firſt fight of the glorious Properties of it, and eſpecially upon the account of its <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Command, and the <hi>Eternal</hi> Duration of it. For what elſe is his <hi>coming in Glory</hi> for, but to take poſſeſſion of the whole World, and to reign with his Father, and his Saints in it, to all Eternity? And though he delivers up his Kingdom to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the laſt end, yet he has ſo much ſhare in it, as to have it here called <hi>his Everlaſting Kingdom:</hi> As elſewhere it is ſaid alſo; <hi>And he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi> But it may be ſaid, that this <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> was verified of Chriſt at his firſt coming: For at his Aſcenſion into Heaven, he is ſaid <hi>to have all Power given unto him both in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Heaven and Earth.</hi> It muſt therefore be ſhown, that by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the Kingdom of the Son of Man in this place, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:204884:70"/> be that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Power which was given to Chriſt at his <note place="margin">Dan. VII.</note> Aſcenſion into Heaven, and his <hi>ſitting on the Right hand of Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe, it is to be conſidered, That the Kingdom of the Son of Man, and That of the Saints, in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is the ſame Kingdom; for they both are deſcribed as beginning at the ſame time, at the deſtruction of the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> and have the ſame Characters of an Univerſal and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Dominion, which it is impoſſible for two different Kingdoms to have at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>And the Kingdom of the Saints has theſe Properties in it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To begin at the deſtruction of a Kingdom, that did <hi>devour</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 21, 22.</note> 
                        <hi>the whole Earth,</hi> and of a great tyrannizing Power in it, who did <hi>wear out the Saints of the Moſt High;</hi> that is, at the deſtruction of <note place="margin">v. 26, 27.</note> all the Enemies of the Church upon Earth; for thereupon it had his Dominion, and all Dominions under the whole Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2dly.</hi> To be in the actual poſſeſſion of the Obedience of <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>All People, Nations,</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> and of <hi>All Dominions under Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3dly.</hi> To be <hi>Eternal,</hi> from that firſt beginning of ſuch an <note place="margin">Ibid. &amp; v. 27.</note> Univerſal Dominion.</p>
                     <p>And this can be nothing but Chriſt's Second Coming in Glory: For tho' all Power both in Heaven and Earth was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him at his Aſcenſion into Heaven, yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That <hi>all things then were not put under him,</hi> and that he had not <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 8.</note> then <hi>put down all Authority, and Rule, and Power;</hi> nor had he <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 24, 25.</note> 
                        <hi>put all his Enemies under his feet;</hi> which yet we ſee is neceſſary to be done, to have His Kingdom be That of the Saints in this 7th of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and which, when it does comes to paſs, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame places does ſhew us to be his Coming in Glory.</p>
                     <p>But what appearance ever was there of ſuch an Univerſal Kingdom of Chriſt on Earth in the time of the Ten <hi>Poman</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions; or in the time of the <hi>Saracen</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them? And what fourth Kingdom, that ruled over all the Earth, was deſtroyed at the Aſcenſion of Chriſt into Heaven, into whoſe Place and Dominion the Kingdom of Chriſt and his Saints did ſucceed?</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:204884:70"/> 2. The Kingdom of the Son of Man, or of the Saints, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have the ſame individual Characters with that ſtate of the Church, which has been already ſhewn (by <hi>Coroll. Prop.</hi> 11.) <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> to be the time of Chriſt's Second Coming in Glory: For they <hi>both begin</hi> at the <hi>laſt end</hi> of a Kingdom, ſignified by A Beaſt, <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 14, 26. Rev. 11. 15.</note> which ruled over all the World, and at the <hi>end</hi> of the laſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Church; and from that time they reign in triumph <hi>for ever and ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are <hi>both</hi> from their firſt beginning over all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and Eternal: They are therefore deſcribed to reign in the ſame place for the <hi>ſame continuance</hi> of time, and <hi>at</hi> the <hi>ſame particular time;</hi> and it is impoſſible for two different Kingdoms of the ſame nature to be in the <hi>ſame place,</hi> and <hi>at the ſame time.</hi> Wherefore, ſince the <hi>One</hi> of theſe is known to be the time of Chriſt's Second Coming in Glory, the <hi>Other</hi> muſt alſo of neceſſity be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly do we find in <hi>both</hi> the circumſtances of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Saints,</hi> and <hi>overcoming</hi> them juſt <hi>before</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, and a famous remarkable Judgment accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To confirm this ſtill further from this Prophecy it ſelf, if we compare the circumſtances of the Kingdom of the Son of Man in this Chapter, with the deſcription of the Reſurrection in the 12th Chapter, it will be unqueſtionable. For the <hi>time, times,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and an half,</hi> in the 7th verſe of the 12th Chapter, are ſaid to end at the <hi>end of the Wonders</hi> that had before been propheſied of, and at the beginning of the laſt deliverance of the People of God from affliction. Now the <hi>end of the Wonders,</hi> or things of the Prophecy, is the <hi>awaking of thoſe that ſleep in the duſt of the Earth,</hi> v. 2. which, by the circumſtances of <hi>Everlaſting Life,</hi> and <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Contempt,</hi> appears to be a Reſurrection of the Dead; and this muſt certainly be the time of Chriſt's Coming in Glory. And then the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>times</hi> muſt alſo end at this Second Coming of Chriſt, becauſe they are ſaid to end at the concluſion of thoſe Wonders, which is, at the awaking of the Dead.</p>
                     <p>From hence it appears, That theſe <hi>times</hi> in the 12th Chapter, are the ſame particular time with the <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>the dividing of time</hi> in the <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. For they are both of them the ſame length of time, and they both end at the laſt deliverance of the People of God from Perſecution in this World. Thoſe in the 12th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:204884:71"/> are deſcribed to end at <hi>the accompliſhment of a ſcattering of God's</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. XXIV.</note> 
                        <hi>People,</hi> juſt before the awaking of the Dead, or Chriſt's Second Coming in Glory; and thoſe in the 7th Chapter are deſcribed to end at the <hi>deſtruction of the little Horn,</hi> which is followed by an univerſal Reign of the Saints for ever; and therefore ſhews the Perſecution that preceded it, to be the laſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>times</hi> therefore in both Chapters, do end at the ſame time; and being both of the ſame length of duration, they muſt therefore be the ſame particular time from the beginning to the end of it.</p>
                     <p>And hence it appears, That the Kingdom of the Son of Man in the 7th Chapter, is Chriſt's Second Coming in Glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it begins at the end of the <hi>times</hi> in that Chapter, which are the ſame with the <hi>times</hi> in the 12th Chapter, which have juſt now been proved to end at Chriſt's Second Coming in Glory.</p>
                     <p>And here it is well worth the obſerving, what another wreſting of plain words <hi>Grotius</hi> preſents us withal, about the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Grot.</hi> in Dan. 12. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>awaking of the Dead,</hi> ch. 12. v. 2.—He would have the Heathen <hi>Porphyry</hi> to be the beſt Interpreter of theſe words, who makes this riſing of the Dead to be nothing but the return of ſome perſecuted <hi>Jews;</hi> and yet both <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Porphyry</hi> confeſs, That <hi>the words are very wonderfully and artificially put together, to hint at the myſtery of the Reſurrection:</hi> So wonderfully indeed, as it is to be admired how they can be made to intend any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Again, the very ſame peculiar words, and deſcription with theſe in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> about the <hi>coming of the Son of Man,</hi> does our Saviour uſe to ſignifie his <hi>Second Coming in Glory,</hi> Matth. 24. 30, 31. And withal, it may be plainly obſerved, That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that place in <hi>Daniel</hi> in thoſe words, and that deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which it is therefore convenient in the firſt place to be well ſatisfied in.</p>
                     <p>It is affirmed by a very judicious and impartial Critick, That <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi>
                        </note> the term of the <hi>Son of Man</hi> in that verſe of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and which was ſo familiar an expreſſion with him to ſignifie his being the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> could be taken from no other place in the Old Teſtament, as the Name of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but from this 7th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:204884:71"/>
                     <p> But ſurely this will never more be queſtioned, when it is conſidered, That our Saviour, contrary to almoſt all the cuſtom of his Diſcourſes any where elſe, has quoted <hi>Daniel by name,</hi> but a few Verſes before this 30th Verſe, in the very ſame <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> continued Prophecy. When therefore, ſoon after this, we find in that Verſe, the ſame words and circumſtances with theſe here in <hi>Daniel,</hi> about the Coming of the Son of Man; how is it poſſible for any man to queſtion, Whether our Saviour did mean the <hi>ſame thing</hi> with that which was ſignified in <hi>Daniel</hi> by the <hi>ſame words,</hi> unleſs there were ſome ſo very clear ground againſt it, as to force him to queſtion it? Which will not here be found.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> therefore, our chief Adverſary in theſe things, does allow, That the ſame expreſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 64. is a plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this 7th of <hi>Daniel:</hi> which makes him to appear ſo much the more extravagant in his fancy of quite another mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame words, and deſcription of that place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> from what he determines them to ſignifie in St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is now therefore to be confirmed, That by the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and words of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 30, 31. cannot be underſtood any thing but his <hi>Second Coming in Glory;</hi> which will appear from theſe following Conſiderations:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Coming of the Son of Man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 30. is joined with the <hi>end of the world,</hi> for the time of it, as may be ſeen in the queſtion about it, v. 3. And there is no other mention of the end of the world to anſwer that queſtion in all the Chapter, but as it is included in this Coming of the Son of Man, and the <hi>ſending his Angels to gather all</hi> to Judgment after it. As for the phraſe in the Original to ſignifie the <hi>end of the world,</hi>

                        </gap>, it is the very ſame that is made uſe of <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. in three ſeveral places in that one Chapter, for the laſt end of the world, as by all is granted: for in the 39, 40, 49 verſes, it is accompanied with the laſt diſcrimination of the <hi>Good</hi> and the <hi>Evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to evade this, it is alledged, That <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, uſed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. is quite another expreſſion, and can ſignify at beſt no more than the laſt Ages of the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The coming of the Son of Man in that place of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> is joined with the laſt diſcriminating Act of the Good from the Bad, by the ſending his Angels out for that purpoſe, v. 31. which is certainly the ſame Circumſtance with that before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. and which is twice in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter joined with that, which is acknowledged to be the <hi>real</hi> end of the World. This is alſo further confirmed from the 31, 32, verſes of the very next Chapter to this, which is but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Account of the coming of the Son of Man that is <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> here mentioned: In thoſe verſes of the 25th Chapter, there is the ſame circumſtance with that here mentioned of the coming of the Son of Man <hi>with his holy Angels</hi> to diſcriminate the Good from the Evil: And that that Act of the Angel's in the 25 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is certainly at the Day of Judgment, is unqueſtionable from the 46 verſe, and is acknowledged by all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>coming of the Son of Man</hi> is ſaid to be here <hi>with power, and great glory,</hi> and his Angels are employed with him; And ſuch a glorious Coming as that with his <hi>Angels,</hi> is known every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe to ſignify the ſecond Coming of Chriſt: As in Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> 16. 27. where it is joined with the laſt Reward, and follows upon the diſcourſe of gaining, or loſing ones own Soul. As alſo 2 <hi>Theſſalon.</hi> 1. 7. where that Appearance of Chriſt with his Angels, is certainly his coming to Judgment, v. 8. <hi>with flames of fire,</hi> v. 9. to the <hi>everlaſting</hi> deſtruction of thoſe <hi>that obey not the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is alſo the ſame Circumſtance of his coming with his <hi>Angels in glory,</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 25. 31. where it is acknowledged that it ſignifies his coming to Judgment.</p>

                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:204884:72"/> 4. This <hi>coming of the Son of Man</hi> in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is at the ſame time, that <hi>he ſends out his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet, to gather his Elect from all parts of the World;</hi> and that is a peculiar <note place="margin">v. 31.</note> Circumſtance of Chriſt's laſt coming: As is acknowledged in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 16. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The deſcription of his <hi>coming in the clouds of Heaven</hi> was the chief thing that made <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf acknowledge, that this <note place="margin">Grot. <hi>in</hi> v. 30.<hi>—tum praecipue id, quod, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 1. 9, 11.</note> muſt be meant of our Saviour's laſt coming, becauſe it was ſo promiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 11. That he ſhould <hi>come from Heaven upon a Cloud,</hi> juſt as they then ſaw him going into Heaven. And this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17. which is acknowledged to ſignify the laſt coming of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To this may be added the conſideration of the concurrence of moſt of theſe ſame peculiar Circumſtances in places which do unqueſtionably ſignify the <hi>laſt coming of Chriſt.</hi> As in the 31ſt and 32d verſes of the 25th Chapter, where we have almoſt juſt the ſame crowd of particular Expreſſions and Deſcriptions with thoſe in the 30th and 31ſt verſes of the 24th Chapter. There is the mention of his <hi>coming in glory,</hi> and <hi>with his Angels,</hi> and <hi>to gather the Elect from the</hi> reſt out of all Nations. So again in the 4th Chapter of 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 16, 17. there are the Circumſtances of the <hi>Triumph,</hi> and of the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> employed in it, as here. And in the 27th verſe of the 16th Chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> we find the <hi>coming in glory,</hi> and <hi>the Angels,</hi> and the <hi>laſt Reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who can deſire a more convincing Proof of the ſame ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of words in ſeveral places, than to ſee them thus joined with the ſame very many <hi>peculiar</hi> Circumſtances and Expreſſions in all thoſe places? And therefore do we find an almoſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> Conſent amongſt all ſorts of Interpreters, that this <hi>coming of the Son of Man,</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. 30. muſt be his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in glory. <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, in this, is forced to be of the ſame mind with the reſt.</p>

                     <p>And yet if it were leſs intelligible, all that could be made of it, would be but this, That our Saviour had very much impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with his laſt coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that Diſcourſe: For that the coming of the Son of Man there mentioned, is unqueſtionably to be underſtood, of his

                        <hi>coming to Judgment,</hi> is manifeſt from what has been diſcourſed more particularly about it. And the Objections againſt it are too inconſiderable to make it queſtionable.</p>
                     <p>Whatever other mentions of the coming of the Son of Man there may be, that may ſeem to ſignify a ſooner appearance of Chriſt's Kingdom, cannot be of any moment againſt it: For the whole force of the Proof from this place in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> lies upon the <hi>peculiar words</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> that it is deſcribed by.</p>
                     <p>There are indeed ſome Exhortations of our Saviour, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to perſons then living, to watch againſt <hi>the day of this Lord's coming,</hi> as if by that <hi>coming</hi> were meant ſome coming in that Age; but that can be no argument for it. For we meet with the ſame Exhortations in places, where by all it is granted to concern only the laſt coming of Chriſt to Judgment.

And from what has been advanced to make it clear, that our Saviour did refer to the coming of the Son of Man in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where there are the ſame words, and circumſtances of <hi>a glorious appearance with his Angels</hi> at the time of a <hi>great Judgment,</hi> and of an <hi>univerſal dominion of the Saints</hi> over all the Earth; it appears to be unreaſonable to doubt, whether this coming of the Son of Man in <hi>Daniel,</hi> be the ſame with it; and therefore we may ſecurely conclude, that <hi>the Kingdom of the Son of Man in the 7th Chapter of</hi> Daniel, <hi>is Chriſt's ſecond coming in glory.</hi>

                     <p>But it thereby appears, that this Beaſt is plainly drawn from another Original Copy, <hi>viz. That Fourth Beaſt in the 7th of</hi> Daniel.

                     <p>All the difference then betwixt them is, that the <hi>one</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>devoured</hi> thoſe three, and the <hi>other</hi> is ſhown with them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into <hi>his own Body.</hi>

                     <p>But here indeed is the difference betwixt them; that the <hi>one</hi> had Seven Heads, and Ten Horns; and the <hi>other</hi> nothing but the Ten Horns, and the Little Horn. But</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

Since therefore the Little Horn is ſaid to repreſent a remarkable <hi>buſtling</hi> King, and the laſt Head of the Beaſt ſignifies nothing but the laſt King of Seven very <hi>formidable</hi> and turbulent, we have no reaſon at all to fear any difference betwixt them.</p>

So that the whole Beaſt was ſlain and burnt for the Crimes of that Horn, v. 11.

                     <p>From all theſe put together, Though it could not be prov'd to be abſolutely impoſſible from their Characters for the two Kingdoms repreſented by theſe two Beaſts to be otherwiſe than one and the ſame Kingdom; yet how could a man of the moſt wary and cautious judgment withhold from concluding, That it would be a very ſtrange thing, if two Deſcriptions agreeing together in ſuch multitudes of moſt peculiar Characters, never attributed to any Figures before, ſhould not really mean one and the ſame thing? To hear of the Pictures of <hi>two</hi> Beaſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed thus <hi>exactly like</hi> one another in ſuch a ſtrange make of all their Parts and Furniture, with the <hi>ſame</hi> Qualities and Actions belonging to them; the <hi>ſame</hi> manner of riſe, the <hi>ſame</hi> time of continuance, and agreeing in the <hi>ſame</hi> peculiar way and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their Ruine; and <hi>both</hi> theſe Figures interpreted to ſignify the <hi>ſame</hi> things in all their Characters <hi>that are interpreted:</hi> And then to ſee the things wherein they ſeem to differ in <hi>words</hi> and expreſſions, to be found to be in <hi>reality</hi> and ſubſtance the <hi>ſame;</hi> ſure this would make any man forth with reſolve with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that theſe two muſt be the Pictures of the very ſelf-ſame
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:204884:76"/> Beaſt: And (ſince they <hi>both</hi> are ſaid to ſignify Kingdoms) that they muſt repreſent but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Kingdom. And if it ſhould not be ſo, he would conclude, that they were on purpoſe contriv'd by the Relator of them to deceive men into wrong Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of them, if he had given no plain intimation, that they could not poſſibly be the ſame. For to mention a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or two in one, which was not in the mention of the other, would ſignify little to make him think them of different kinds, where there were ſuch ſtrange Agreements, unleſs the Relator had given ſuch a property to the one, as could not be in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the plain deſcription of it, which is not the preſent Caſe.</p>
                     <p>But after all this, from the three laſt Characters of each of theſe Beaſts, it will appear to be abſolutely impoſſible that they ſhould be any thing but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> time of the ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They are <hi>both</hi> ſaid to be deſtroyed juſt before the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and Eternal Kingdom of Chriſt, that <hi>ruled over all the Earth,</hi> and that <hi>for ever:</hi> So that the deſcription of that, in thoſe two places, cannot poſſibly ſignify more than one determinate King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over all the Earth; and when they were deſtroyed, are ſaid at that time both of them to rule over the ſame place, <hi>THE whole Earth,</hi> and for the ſame continuance of time before their deſtruction. But it is abſolutely impoſſible that they ſhould be two different Kingdoms over the ſame <hi>place</hi> at the ſame <hi>time, both</hi> deſtroyed by a Third that ſucceeds in their place. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Univerſal Reign of Chriſt with his Saints, when each of them were to be deſtroyed, was the <hi>ſame time;</hi> and their Rule over the <hi>whole Earth</hi> at that time was over the <hi>ſame place:</hi> And beſides, they had continued the <hi>ſame length of time</hi> over the ſame place before their deſtruction; and were both deſtroyed after the very ſame, <hi>and that</hi> a moſt peculiar and unuſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is, by fire; <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore unqueſtionable, that the Fourth Beaſt in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is the ſame with the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and eſpecially in the time of the Reign of the Little Horn: From hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That</p>

                     <p>And from hence ſtill is it further confirmed, That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Son of Man, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and the Reign of Chriſt over <note place="margin">Coroll.

                     <p>Thus does this laſt Propoſition about the <hi>Fourth Kingdom,</hi> and the former about the <hi>coming of the Son of Man,</hi> much more ſtrengthen the proof of one another, and yet have evidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them <hi>in themſelves,</hi> without any neceſſary dependance upon one another; ſo that either of them might have been ſet alone by themſelves; but they are ſtill more abundantly cleared and ſtrengthned by the help of one another's Light.</p>

                     <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that both this Propoſition, and the former, and their Conſectaries are denied by <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others; but upon what ſmall grounds for it, and againſt how great an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary, may be ſeen, <hi>Cap. ult.

                     <p>The <hi>modern Jews</hi> are juſtly admired for denying, that by the Son of Man in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is meant the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> But it is <hi>much more monſtrous</hi> in theſe men, <hi>firſt</hi> to grant that the Name of the Son of Man is the moſt familiar Name of Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; <hi>and alſo,</hi> that the term of the Son of Man joined with the ſame Expreſſions and Circumſtances in the Goſpels, that we find it with in <hi>Daniel,</hi> does plainly refer to this place in the 7th of <hi>Daniel: And that</hi> in the Goſpels, when joined with thoſe ſame Expreſſions, it ſignifies the coming of Chriſt at the end of the World: <hi>And yet</hi> to maintain, that in <hi>Daniel</hi> it ſignifies not ſo much as the <hi>power of Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>ſometimes</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> only, and <hi>ſometimes</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> fury againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> notwithſtanding that that coming of the Son of Man is ſet out in <hi>Daniel</hi> under the Character of an Univerſal and Eternal Kingdom of the Saints, upon the deſtruction of all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>There could not well be a plainer Inſtance to ſhew, how poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is for <hi>Grotius</hi> to be ſingular in his own fancy, where there is a clear evidence, and the general Authority of <hi>all Ages</hi> againſt him.</p>
                     <p>But a much more ſatisfactory Inſtance of the Confidence of a Learned Man againſt open day-light, is that of a Perſon who is eſteemed a great <hi>Critick</hi> in Hiſtory, about this Fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> was that of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> who were the firſt Ruling Nation of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> who began the total Captivity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which happened in the time of <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf; And of this have we the Prophecy in <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> And the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire is ſaid by <hi>Megaſthenes,</hi> in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> to have extended to <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars.</p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:204884:79"/>
                     <p> The <hi>next</hi> were the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who conquered the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and who continued their Empire under the name of the <hi>Medes and Perſians,</hi> as <hi>one entire people united into one Empire,</hi> till the time of <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi> And the Prophecy of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Conqueſt we have in <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> and the Hiſtory of it in <hi>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Eſther, Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy conquered, and ſucceeded the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and appeared in its greateſt magnitude under <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> beginner of that Empire. But after his death, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Captains it was broken into a great many Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which were in a continual change of Maſters, till at laſt the whole power of the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſetled it ſelf in <hi>four</hi> diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>viz. Egypt, Syria, Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> or <hi>Pergamus,</hi> which was the ſame Dominion with <hi>Thrace,</hi> though the name was changed.</p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Syrian</hi> Line of this <hi>fourfold</hi> Monarchy came <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who made himſelf ſo famous by his prophanation of the Temple of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom the things of the Little Horn in the 8th Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> were always interpreted.—And the Wars and Marriages of the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings ſet out in the 11th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> are exactly anſwerable to the Hiſtory of them; ſo that <hi>Porphyry</hi> concluded from that, that the whole Prophecy wat but an Hiſtory of what had been done before.</p>
                     <p>The Prophecies of this Monarchy are chiefly in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and hinted at in <hi>Zechariah,</hi> but very <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi> foretold in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> many hundreds of years before the time of its Reign, and the Hiſtory of it is in the Books of the <hi>Maccabees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were the <hi>Fourth</hi> Conquerors: And, after their Conqueſts of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> were the moſt <hi>formidable</hi> Empire <hi>that ever appeared:</hi> At the beginning of this Empire was our Saviour born; and the Prophecies about it are <hi>chiefly</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and the Hiſtory of the beginning of it in the Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It appears then by this, that the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſame Ruling Nations over the Church of God, that are foretold in the other Prophets. But <hi>Daniel</hi> is judged to be much more obſcure than <hi>others,</hi> becauſe that which in <hi>others</hi> is ſignified by plain words, in <hi>Daniel</hi> is repreſented by <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Hieroglyphicks.</hi> And yet thoſe Figures are found to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in moſt places, and are of the ſame kind with thoſe that are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204884:79"/> ſometimes uſed by the other Prophets to ſignify the ſame Ruling Nations; as the names of Beaſts and Horns are often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amonſt the other Prophets for that purpoſe: But that which takes away all the fear of the unintelligibleneſs of theſe Figures, is the explication that is given <hi>by name</hi> of the Beaſts, and their Horns, in the 8th Chapter, which is by all acknowledged to be very manifeſtly determined; and is a clear inſtance of the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> ſignification of thoſe myſtical Terms in all <hi>other</hi> parts of the Prophecy beſides.</p>
                     <p>From hence it was, that there has been ſo unanimous an agreement amongſt the Interpreters of <hi>all former Ages</hi> concerning the particular Kingdoms that are ſignified by <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Figures; which in all reaſon ought therefore to determine, all Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the ſearch of the <hi>conſtant</hi> ſignification of Beaſt, and their parts, in all thoſe places, to fix the notion of the Beaſt, and its Heads and Horns in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> For the Book of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> is without any controverſie owned by all to be the place to which thoſe uncouth Figures in the <hi>Revelations</hi> do refer, and from whence moſt of the peculiar Phraſes for ſuch things are tranſcribed: And from an attentive conſideration of all the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Beaſts, and their parts, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> one may obſerve the <hi>conſtant uniform ſignification</hi> of them to be according to this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Propoſition.</p>

                     <p> To make the proof of this the more full, and to ſhew how <note place="margin">Dan. VIII.</note> 
                        <hi>uniform</hi> and conſtant to it ſelf this Prophecy is in all its Figures, and that it may appear, that there is one conſtant and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſignification in the uſe of them; I will prove by an <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the particular Inſtances,</hi> That this is a property in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the Prophetical Figures of this Book, which ſignify Kingdoms, as The Beaſts every-where do; That by every ſuch Figure in <hi>general,</hi> as the common ſubject of its parts is to be underſtood the Rule of ſome particular Nation, or People; and by the <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> of the ſame kind in it, that are ſaid to denote Dominion, is meant the Supreme Government of that Kingdom. And if they be ſaid to come <hi>after one another,</hi> they do denote the Succeſſions of them in the ſame ſtate: But if they be ſaid to be <hi>all in Rule at the ſame time,</hi> they ſignify ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Kingdoms in that Nation, or People.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>general</hi> proof from the uniform ſignification of all Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and their parts, will give us the more aſſurance of the common uſe of all theſe Prophetical Schemes; and ſo does make the Concluſions about any of the particular Inſtances contained under it, ſo much the ſtronger, and the more undoubted.</p>
                     <p>Now there are Ten whole Figures in <hi>Daniel</hi> which are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to ſignify Kingdoms there, and they all confirm that general Obſervation: As may be ſeen by the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>The Two Figures in the 8th Chapter concerning the <hi>Ram</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Daniel VIII.</note> and the <hi>He Goat,</hi> are of the moſt known ſignification of any, becauſe of the particular Interpretation that is there given of them; and therefore it will be the moſt convenient to begin with them.</p>
                     <p>The Ram with its two Horns is ſaid to be the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 20.</note> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> which does very plainly determine it to ſignify a <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> in the notion of it: The Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> cannot poſſibly ſignify one ſingle perſon only, or only the perſon of <hi>Darius</hi> conquered by <hi>Alexander,</hi> though that Conqueſt ſeems to be the main thing there deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The Ram therefore ſaid with his two Horns to be the Kings of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> muſt ſignify a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>Ruling Powers</hi> in that Dominion, ſince there was but one King of that Dominion at one time. And then the two Horns being joined with the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204884:80"/> ſingle mention of the Ram, and there being mentioned but juſt two ſorts of Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> that are ſaid to be ſignified by the Ram with his two Horns; what can be plainer, than that the Ram under each of theſe two Horns does ſignify each of thoſe two ſorts of Kings? For an <hi>Horn</hi> does very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſignify in Scripture the Ruling or Commanding Power of the thing with which it is joined. And the Ram being the ſame <hi>common ſubject</hi> of both the Horns, ſince the two Horns are found to be the two kinds of Kings, the Ram, of which they are the Horns, muſt be the Kingdom of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> of which they are the Kings; or, which is the ſame, the Ram muſt be the <hi>common</hi> Ruling Nation of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> of which the Horns are the Kings.</p>
                     <p>For ſince the Ram with them is ſaid in <hi>the whole</hi> to be <hi>the Kings of Media and Perſia,</hi> and ſince his Horns are now found to be the <hi>Kings</hi> in that expreſſion, the remaining ſignification for the Ram, as the common ſubject of both of them, muſt be that which remains of what <hi>the whole</hi> is ſaid to ſignify, and that is <hi>Media and Perſia,</hi> or the Ruling Nation of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> And though there were two different Lines of Kings in that Dominion, <hi>firſt</hi> the <hi>Median</hi> Line, <hi>and then</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> as they are repreſented by two different Horns, yet was the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion always counted one and the ſame common Kingdom; and both the Nations were always joined together, as one united People: Thus in the <hi>time of the Median Rule,</hi> the Laws of that common Kingdom are called the <hi>Laws of the Medes and Perſians</hi> thrice in one Chapter, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. And again, in <hi>the time of the Perſian Rule,</hi> all over the Book of <hi>Eſther,</hi> is that one Kingdom called <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Media.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then to ſhew the Succeſſions of the two different ſorts of Ruling Powers in this one Kingdom, the two Horns of the Ram are mentioned with this Remark<hi>—That which came up laſt, was</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>the higheſt,</hi> which ſhews that they ſucceeded after one another; And the laſt of the two Horns being the laſt of the two Kings, that they are both ſaid to be, muſt be that which is laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Interpretation, or the King of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Line; which might well be repreſented by an higher Horn than the <hi>Median</hi> Line juſt before it, becauſe of the encreaſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy from the time of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſo as to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204884:81"/> have the Title of the <hi>Great King</hi> all over the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> where the Prophecy was given.</p>
                     <p>The He Goat indeed in that Chapter, at the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angel's Interpretation of him, may ſeem to be but a ſingle Perſon; for he is ſaid to be the <hi>King of Greece;</hi> But <note place="margin">v. 21, 22.</note> when we ſee a <hi>firſt</hi> King in him, and then <hi>four</hi> Kingdoms after him, repreſented by the ſeveral Horns of that Beaſt, It is altogether unqueſtionable, that the He Goat himſelf is ſomething that belongs in common to all his Horns, or Ruling Powers repreſented by them: And that can be nothing but the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, or the Ruling Time of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> The beginning of which is ſignified by the Conqueſt of the Ruling Monarchy of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that was before it, by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> called here the <hi>Great Horn;</hi> And the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and the continuance of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy from that eſtabliſhment of it under the four ſetled Kingdoms of <hi>Macedonia, Syria, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> or <hi>Pergamus</hi> (which was the ſame) is ſhewn by the <hi>four Horns</hi> coming up in the place of the <hi>firſt Horn that was broken.</hi> For though there were more Kingdoms than four ſoon after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s death, yet they were were in a perpetual change; and rather a tumultuous <hi>Scuffle</hi> of his Captains, than any determinate number of Kingdoms, till they came to be ſetled in thoſe <hi>four.</hi> So that till <hi>then</hi> the whole Monarchy could not be ſaid to have any particular form in it. Beſides, that during the time of that ſcuffle, or at leaſt the greateſt part of it, there were ſome or other of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Line remaining, who might well enough be looked upon as the continuance of the Reign of the <hi>firſt</hi> Horn. But <hi>after that,</hi> the Monarchy ſetled in the four mentioned diviſions, till the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſt. There is indeed a little Horn ſaid to <hi>come out of one of the four.</hi> But <note place="margin">v. 9.</note> by that expreſſion it appears, that it cannot well be taken for any thing elſe, than for a part of the Ruling Time of the ſame Horn which it <hi>came out of;</hi> and therefore is it generally judged to the ſingle Reign of <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By both theſe Figures in the 8th Chapter it appears, that the Ruling <hi>Parts</hi> of a Figure do not only ſignify the ſeveral Governments in the Nation; but alſo the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of all the particular Perſons in that form of Government.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:204884:81"/> As the four Horns ſignify the Succeſſion of all the Kings in thoſe Kingdoms, and the two Horns of the Ram <hi>all</hi> the Line of the <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings.</p>
                     <p>Of this the 11th Chapter is ſtill a further confirmation, <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 3, 4.</note> where, after the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> there is the mention of the Realm of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of a mighty King, who ſhould have a Kingdom, which ſhould be broken, and divided towards the four Winds of Heaven: juſt as in the <hi>other</hi> the four Horns are ſaid to <hi>come up towards the four Winds of Heaven.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 8.</note> And a Kingdom broken, and divided towards the four Winds, can be nothing but a <hi>fourfold</hi> Kingdom; according as it is ſaid in the other, that the great Horn being broken (ſaid to be the firſt King) <hi>four Kingdoms ſhould ſtand up in the Nations;</hi> And then two of theſe Diviſions, according to the points of the Wind, are the ſubject of the greateſt part of that 11th Chapter, under the Names of the King of the <hi>North,</hi> and the King of the <hi>South;</hi> which though they ſeem to ſignify but two ſingle Kings, yet are indeed a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of many Kings in each Diviſion. And at laſt one of this Succeſſion is there ſet out as much more conſiderable for his Villany, than any of the reſt; juſt as the Little Horn was in the 8th Chapter, which is there ſaid to <hi>come out of</hi> one of the four Horns, to denote him to be a ſingle King of that Diviſion.</p>
                     <p>And that all theſe Expreſſions were very clear ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, and of the Changes in it, till about the end of it, there can be no greater evidence than that Scoff of <hi>Porphyry</hi> the Philoſoper, mentioned by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who derides this part of the Prophecies of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> with a great aſſurance, that it muſt have been wrote after the things were done, becauſe of the exact agreement of it with the particular Circumſtances of the Times, which it foretells.</p>
                     <p>From theſe two Chapters may it alſo be ſeen, That Kings <note place="margin">N. B.</note> and Kingdoms are promiſcuouſly uſed for any intimations of Rule, whether in a Ruling Nation, or in a ſingle Perſon when it is ſaid to be his Kingdom; As we ordinarily uſe the terms of the King of <hi>France,</hi> or of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſignify the whole Monarchy of that Nation for all the time that it continues in power; and the terms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> for the Actions
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204884:82"/> of the Kings of thoſe Places. For Example, The King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have been always at war; <hi>England</hi> was the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Friend.</p>

                           <hi>All Interpreters agreed, That the Five Kingdoms in the</hi> 2<hi>d and 7th Chapters, are the ſame Kingdoms, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be in particular. This attempted to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated from the Characters of each of them in both Chapters. The Fourth and Fifth in each of thoſe Chapters proved to be neceſſarily the ſame particular Kingdoms.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere is now good ground to apprehend, that the Figures in <hi>Daniel</hi> were deſigned to be underſtood; And that there is an exact conformity amongſt them in the <hi>general</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of the ſame kind of Characters in every one of them, as the exact agreement of the Two figures in the 8th Chapter in the ſame <hi>general</hi> ſignification of <hi>A Monarchy,</hi> and the ſeveral Changes of the Ruling Power of that Monarchy has been ſhown to be very plainly expreſſed in the words of the Prophecy it ſelf. And this is ſufficient to excite ones curioſity to a more particular examination of the other Figures of that Book, which, thô they have no ſuch plain determinations of their ſignification, as the former, in expreſs words; yet are there ſuch peculiar deſcriptions of them in the explication that is given of them, as upon the firſt, ſerious reflections would make one very confident, that it was no hard matter either to come to the particular knowledg of them, or to find them conformable to the Rule of the preſent Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>It is a conſiderable encouragement to our hopes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That it is <hi>almoſt unanimouſly agreed upon by all the ſeveral parties of Interpreters,</hi> That the other Figures in the 2d and 7th Chapters, are the ſucceſſions of the four famous Monarchies, from the time of the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf, till ſome univerſal Kingdom of Chriſt at the end of them.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider them both according to their deſcriptions in each Chapter.</p>
                     <p>In the 7th Chapter there are Five Kingdoms repreſented by <hi>four Beaſts,</hi> and a Majeſtical appearance of <hi>the Kingdom of the Saints.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>If we can find theſe Five Kingdoms in each to be the very <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 36.</note> ſame Kingdoms in <hi>reality,</hi> as they ſeem at the firſt view of them to be from their being exactly the ſame number of Kingdoms, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and from the extraordinary likeneſs of the fifth of them in each, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it will be eaſy from thence to conclude, what is the ſignification of any Figure in <hi>general,</hi> as diſtinct from the <hi>ſeveral parts</hi> of it, that are repreſented with it in Rule and Power; which is the <hi>firſt part of the Propoſition.</hi>

                     <p>And here is this further encouragement, to ground our hopes of it upon, That it is unanimouſly agreed by all Interpreters of <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> all Ages that are <hi>conſiderable,</hi> That they are the ſame Five King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in each of thoſe Chapters; thô there be a different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in ſome few of them from the reſt about the particular names of theſe Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe they have not diſtinctly proved the certainty of thoſe Grounds, upon which they build this common agreement, It may be uſeful for a conſtant aſſured ſatisfaction of this point, once for all to reflect upon the evidence that there is for it, and to put it into a cloſe and diſtinct order to make it unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>Conſider then <hi>firſt,</hi> That the 5th Kingdom in the 7th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">v. 13, 14.</note> muſt be ſome <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> For it was a <hi>Kingdom given to one like the Son of Man, by the Ancient of days,</hi> who had <note place="margin">v. 9, 10.</note> Hoſts of Angels Miniſtring unto him; which cannot poſſibly be any thing, but <hi>God himſelf;</hi> And the name of the Son of Man is ſo peculiarly owned by Chriſt himſelf all over the Goſpels, That he cannot be more plainly known by the name of Chriſt, or of Jeſus, than by that. And 'tis obſerved by a very accurate <note place="margin">Mr. Mede.</note> Critick, That there is no other place in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> that he could fetch this name of the Son of Man from, as a name of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but from this very place of <hi>Daniel;</hi> The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which our Saviour doth alſo expreſly add to that name, in his Prophecy about the <hi>Coming of the Son of Man in the Clouds of Heaven with great glory,</hi> which we find in all the three Goſpels; and is the ſame with what is ſaid here, <hi>Of the coming of the Son of Man in the Clouds of Heaven to the Ancient of days,</hi> with an infinite multitude of Angels about his Throne, and a very glorious appearance.</p>

                     <p> Conſider <hi>next,</hi> That this Kingdom of the Son of Man in the 7th Chapter, is ſaid to be both <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> or over all the Earth. There could not well be more care taken to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this, than there ſeems to have been by the fullneſs of the expreſſions for both of theſe; For <hi>The Eternity</hi> of it in ſuch words as theſe, an <hi>Everlaſting Dominion, which ſhall not paſs away,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> and <hi>a kingdom that ſhall not be deſtroyed;</hi> and <hi>a kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever;</hi> as if it had been on purpoſe to ſtop all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions of ambiguity in the uſe of the word <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and <hi>for ever.</hi> And then to aſſure the real <hi>univerſality</hi> of it—It is called, A Kingdom, that <hi>all people, nations and languages ſhould ſerve him,</hi> And the <hi>greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.—</hi>And, <hi>All Dominions ſhall obey him;</hi> And it did ſucceed in <note place="margin">v. 27. v. 23.</note> the place of a Fourth Kingdom upon Earth, which had <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the whole earth, and trod it down.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If now we look into the 5th Kingdom, <hi>in the ſecond Chapter,</hi> we ſhall find juſt the ſame Characters of it from the 44th Verſe. It was to be <hi>ſet up by the God of Heaven,</hi> It was <hi>never to be deſtroyed,</hi> nor to be <hi>left to other people;</hi> but was <hi>to ſtand for ever:</hi> which ſecures the <hi>Eternity</hi> of it from any ſucceſſions after it. And the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of it appears from its <hi>breaking in pieces, and conſuming all other kingdoms</hi> which had Ruled over all the Earth, eſpecially the <hi>Fourth</hi> Kingdom, which before it had <hi>ſubdued all things,</hi> even a third Kingdom, which <hi>bare Rule over all the</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here then are <hi>Two</hi> Kingdoms, <hi>Both without End, Both over all the Earth;</hi> and therefore <hi>Both</hi> in the <hi>ſame place.</hi> Let the Earth ſignify what it will, ſince it muſt ſignify in both places at leaſt the Prophets Countrey, as all agree, this makes it appear, That the latter time of both, is moſt undoubtedly the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>both at a time,</hi> (or eternal) in the <hi>ſame place,</hi> which no two diſtinct Kingdoms can properly be, that are of the ſame kind, as theſe are deſcribed to be, Both the <hi>Kingdoms of the God of Heaven,</hi> and ſuch as began to be <hi>ſet up in the days of the other Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, they <hi>both</hi> began the Univerſality of their Reign at the Ruin of a Power, which had <hi>devoured the whole earth,</hi> and <note place="margin">Ch. 2. 39, 40. Ch. 7. 23, 26.</note> which had <hi>broken in pieces,</hi> and conſumed all other Kingdoms, and did themſelves <hi>Rule over all the earth</hi> in the room of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſo that they both then continue at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:204884:84"/> 
                        <hi>ſame place;</hi> and the continuance of them both is to all <hi>eternity.</hi> And then they <hi>begin</hi> their Reign in that <hi>ſame place</hi> together: Or elſe, that which ſhould come <hi>after</hi> the other, would put an end to it, which is a contradiction to the Eternity of either of them.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems then to be abſolutely impoſſible, That the Fifth Kingdom in each of thoſe Chapters, ſhould not be one and the ſame Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and which began at the ruin of another univerſal dominion before it.</p>
                     <p>Now, if the Fifth Kingdom in each of theſe Chapters be the ſame, the Fourth alſo in each of them before it, muſt be the ſame. For the Fourth Kingdom <hi>in each of thoſe Chapters,</hi> was the only Ruling <hi>power over all the earth,</hi> when it was deſtroyed by the laſt. For by the deſtruction of it, the Fifth got its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion <hi>over all the earth</hi> And ſo the Fourth could not poſſibly be more than one and the ſame Kingdom in <hi>each of the Chapters,</hi> becauſe the <hi>whole earth</hi> in each muſt, as has been obſerved, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify at leaſt the ſame place; and there could be but one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the <hi>ſame place</hi> at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> that each of them in thoſe Chapters is ſaid to be deſtroyed by the laſt. For they are both deſtroyed by the <hi>ſame</hi> Fifth Kingdom, as has been ſhown, at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> That is, at the beginning of the Univerſal Reign of that Kingdom in each Chapter. Two different Kingdoms cannot be deſtroyed by a Third in the ſame place, and at the ſame time. And the Fourth Kingdom in each, is one Ruling <note place="margin">Chap. 7. v. 27.</note> Power over all the Earth at the time that the <hi>greatneſs of the Kingdom of the</hi> Fifth <hi>under the whole Heaven,</hi> began by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of it.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Five Kingdoms in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter of</hi> Daniel, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly <hi>ſucceſſive to one another. This agreed on by Interpreters; and particularly evinced upon ſeveral grounds. The nature of theſe Kingdoms ſhewn, from their</hi> immediate Succeſſion <hi>to one another. Not ſucceſſive forms of Government in the ſame Nation; nor part of them of that kind. From hece neceſſary, that they muſt be the Four Monarchies. And therefore muſt the Third in the</hi> 2<hi>d and the 7th Chapter be the ſame Kingdom. The Firſt and Second alſo in both Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters proved to be the ſame.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE ſureſt way to demonſtrate the reſt of theſe five King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to be the <hi>ſame,</hi> is, to find, that thoſe <hi>in the Second Chapter</hi> are <hi>immediately ſucceſſive</hi> to one another. For ſince the <hi>firſt</hi> of the Kingdoms in the Second Chapter, is <hi>known</hi> to be the Dominion of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>the laſt</hi> of them to be ſome Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>pag. praeced.</hi> If they be all in an <hi>immediate</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 38.</note> ſucceſſion from the firſt to the laſt, that will ſhew what kind of Kingdoms they muſt needs be, to be able to fill up the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time betwixt thoſe two Kingdoms by <hi>immediate</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and thereby will make it appear from Hiſtory, what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms alſo they muſt be in <hi>particular;</hi> and this will give light enough to find them to be the ſame with thoſe <hi>in the 7th Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Five Kingdoms <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter</hi> are <hi>ſucceſſive</hi> to one <note place="margin">Dan. II.</note> another, is undoubted. For of the Second it is ſaid—And <hi>after thee</hi> ſhall ariſe another Kingdom; And of the Third, That it ſhould <hi>bear Rule over all the Earth;</hi> and ſo could it not be at the ſame time with any other that was different from it in the Earth, at leaſt where the Prophet lived; And it is agreed by all, that the Prophet's Countrey did belong to this Third King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And then of the Fourth, that it ſhould <hi>break in pieces,</hi> and <hi>conſume all Kingdoms</hi> that had been before mentioned, and ſo muſt come after them.</p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:204884:85"/>
                     <p> And then, That theſe <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter</hi> are all <hi>immediately</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive <note place="margin">Dan. II.</note> to one another, it is unanimouſly agreed amongſt all kinds of Interpreters, Jews and Chriſtians of all Ages that are any <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> thing <hi>conſiderable;</hi> which ſhews it to be here ſo plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if not expreſſed in words, That the common ſenſe of all conſidering Perſons would judge it to be ſo from the uſual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of ſuch words as it is ſignified by. For how otherwiſe could thoſe, who differ from one another in almoſt every thing elſe, be ſuppoſed to be ſo willing to agree together in this, where there may be a <hi>great diſadvantage</hi> given againſt the Party, which they embrace, by allowing it, but no manner of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage gained by it? The Jews would be much ſurer of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for their deferring the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> if the firſt Four Kingdoms were not determined to be the Four Monarchies <hi>immediately</hi> ſucceeding one another; And it would not appear that Antichriſt went along with the Kingdom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if the whole four were not found to be neceſſarily ſucceſſive Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, that came <hi>immediately</hi> after one another from the times of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The grounds of this agreement about the immediate Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe Kingdoms from the Text, may be theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The mention of the number of them from the time of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> to the Kingdom of Chriſt, ſeems to be plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to be, to foreſhew the determinate time of that Kingdom. For there is nothing mentioned in any of the reſt (excepting that Tyranny in the laſt times of the Fourth Kingdom, which uſhers in the Kingdom of Chriſt) about any Religious concern, or any Action of God, which yet is ordinarily the buſineſs of every Divine Prophecy. <hi>Daniel</hi> does expreſly tell <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> that the end of his Dream was to <hi>make known</hi> to him from God, <hi>what ſhould be in the latter days;</hi> And by the <hi>latter days</hi> muſt be there underſtood at leaſt the latter days of thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms which are the ſubject of the Dream, and therefore muſt they include the <hi>days</hi> of the laſt of thoſe Five Kingdoms, or the time of the Kingdom of Chriſt therein mentioned. The <hi>whole number</hi> then ſeems to be wholly for this end, to ſhew how many Succeſſions of Empire there ſhould be betwixt the Reign of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>'s Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>For who would not aſſuredly conclude it to be for that end <hi>only,</hi> when there is nothing conſiderable ſpoken of the reſt of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:204884:85"/> number; And when the gloriouſeſt ſtate of things that ever was mentioned, is ſet forth in that <hi>laſt</hi> Kingdom with this Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Interpretation of them all, that the whole ſhew was to <hi>make known what ſhould be in the latter days?</hi> And how could that be poſſibly ſhewn by ſuch an orderly number, unleſs there had been no other Kingdoms betwixt them? This therefore does make it manifeſt, that the Succeſſion of theſe Kingdoms was <hi>immediate,</hi> to meaſure out the exact time of the coming of Chriſt in glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An orderly number, when joined with Succeſſive Reigns, as it is here, under the names of a Third, and a Fourth King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (v. 39, 40.) is generally uſed in ſpeech to ſignify an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> orderly Succeſſion: And who would ever call thoſe a Third, or a Fourth Kingdom from the Firſt, which had two or three more coming in betwixt <hi>them</hi> and the Firſt?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And then the laſt of the Five is known to be <hi>immediately</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 44. Chap. 7. 26.</note> ſucceſſive to the Fourth (pag. 120.) which is an inſtance, to ſhew the manner of the Succeſſion of all the reſt, unleſs there were any thing clearer againſt it, which is not by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The parts alſo of the <hi>Statue,</hi> which repreſents theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, are <hi>immediatly</hi> joined to one another, which muſt denote a property in the things repreſented ſome way anſwerable to it; and that in Succeſſive Kingdoms can be nothing elſe but the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Succeſſion of them.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe grounds it may ſafely be concluded, That theſe Four Kingdoms <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter,</hi> do <hi>immediatly</hi> ſucceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; eſpecially when there is nothing offered againſt it; but on the contrary, as has been obſerved, it has the unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all the differing Parties of Interpreters: And by that it appears, that in the Judgment of all that have conſidered theſe things, it is ſo plainly ſuggeſted from the Text, That, unleſs it be really ſo, there is occaſion given for an unavoidable deluſion about ſuch things of moment, as the great Tyranny of the laſt King of the Fourth Kingdom over the Church of God, and the Univerſal Eternal Kingdom of Chriſt ſucceeding it; and which the whole Prophecy was deſigned wholly to make known, as is expreſſed, v. 28. <note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may therefore now be determined what kind of Kingdoms theſe <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter</hi> are.</p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:204884:86"/>
                     <p> For they cannot poſſibly <hi>be the</hi> Four Reigns of ſo many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſons, either in the ſame, or in different Nations: In which ſenſe Kingdoms <hi>are</hi> ſometimes <hi>taken.</hi> For the Four longeſt ſingle Reigns that ever were heard of in an <hi>immediate</hi> Succeſſion to one another, do not reach to half the number of years that there are from the time of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (here ſaid <note place="margin">v. 38.</note> to be the firſt) to any Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Four Kingdoms then muſt neceſſarily be ſuch Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Kingly Power, as include the times of a great many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Rulers in them. And then, They muſt be <hi>either</hi> ſo many ſucceſſive Forms of the Sovereign Power in the ſame Nation (as Chap. 8. 22. the changes of the governing Form of the ſame Nation are called different Kingdoms; and as the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy, may be ſaid to be two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Kingdoms.) <hi>Or elſe,</hi> they muſt be Four Kingdoms of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nations in ſucceſſion to one another; <hi>Or ſome</hi> of them Forms of Government in the ſame Nation, and <hi>others</hi> the Rule of different Nations. For it ſeems hardly poſſibly to find any other acceptation of Succeſſive Kingdoms, but in one of theſe ſenſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is certain, that they cannot be Four Succeſſive Forms of Sovereignty <hi>in the ſame Nation.</hi> For ſince the firſt is known to be the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Nation, the end of that would then be the <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 38.</note> end of all the Four, and the beginning of a Kingdom of Chriſt upon Earth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither can they be <hi>part of them</hi> Forms of Sovereignty <hi>in the ſame Nations.</hi> For the firſt of them is known to be the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> Nation, which had no differing Forms of Sovereignty in it, from the time of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to the laſt end of it; and therefore the firſt muſt neceſſarily be the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy <hi>only:</hi> And the next in <hi>immediate</hi> ſucceſſion to it, muſt be the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarchy upon the ſame account of its continuing in the ſame Monarchichal Form of Sovereignty, from the beginning of it under <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the laſt Conqueſt of it under <hi>Darius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But about the Third Kingdom <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter,</hi> there may be ſome queſtion; For that next the <hi>Perſian</hi> is repreſented <hi>even</hi> in this very Prophecy, Chap. 8. 21, 22. with two ſeveral Forms of the Sovereign Power of it ſucceeding one another under the name of the Kingdom of the Firſt King, and of a Fourfold Kingdom after him.</p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:204884:86"/>
                     <p> But the Third alſo does appear to be <hi>nothing</hi> but the <hi>whole</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dan.</hi> II, &amp; VII.</note> 
                        <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy from its Succeſſion to the <hi>Perſian, till its</hi> Conqueſt by <hi>the Roman.</hi> For <hi>the</hi> Fourth, that is next to it, is already found to be the ſame with the Fourth Kingdom in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> pag. 121. And that Fourth in the 7th Chapter is already known to be a Kingdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Prop.</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p>The Third Kingdom therefore <hi>beginning</hi> immediately after the Second, or <hi>Perſian</hi> Conqueſt, and <hi>ending</hi> but immediately before the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſt <hi>(immediate Succeſſion</hi> being common to all the Four) it muſt neceſſarily be the <hi>whole</hi> continuance of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy from the <hi>Perſian</hi> to the <hi>Roman,</hi> becauſe the Fourth Kingdom is already known to be the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus then do we at laſt find, that theſe Four Kingdoms <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter,</hi> muſt be the Kingdoms of Four Ruling Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions immediately ſucceeding one another; and that it is at the ſame time determined what Nations they are in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                     <p>From hence then it appears, that the Third <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d and the 7th Chapters,</hi> muſt be the ſame Ruling Nation.</p>
                     <p>For the Third <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter,</hi> was immediately before that, which is the ſame Fourth in both Chapters, <hi>pag.</hi> 121. <hi>&amp; Paragr. praeced.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that Third <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter ruled over all the Earth,</hi> and <note place="margin">v. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>therefore included</hi> in it any other Kingdom of the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Earth that was deſtroyed at the beginning of the ſame Fourth in the 7th Chapter. Now the Fourth <hi>in the 7th Chapter</hi> did <hi>break in pieces</hi> the <note place="margin">v. 23.</note> Third there that was before it; and therefore that Third <hi>in the 7th Chapter</hi> muſt be the ſame with, or be included in the Third <hi>of the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, by the term of <hi>all the Earth,</hi> muſt at leaſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 39.</note>

                     <p> There is no queſtion now to be made about the ſameneſs of the Firſt and Second in each Chapters; For ſince they are the Firſt and Second to the ſame Third in both Chapters <hi>(ſeg. praeced.)</hi> And that the uſe of the word Kingdom is found to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify a Ruling Nation <hi>(pag.</hi> 107.) And ſince the two firſt <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter</hi> are already determined to be the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians (ibid.)</hi> The Prophetical uſe of the ſame words with the ſame things, is ſufficient <hi>(by Rule the</hi> 3<hi>d)</hi> to ſatisfy any, that they ſignify the ſame things in both Chapters.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, that they are all repreſented <hi>in the 7th Chapter</hi> to be great remarkable Kingdoms under the names of <hi>Great Beaſts,</hi> and in ſucceſſion after one another; And then, The Second be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy <hi>in the 7th Chapter,</hi> can be no other Kingdom but the <hi>Perſian,</hi> as it is in this very Prophet alſo ſhewn in the 8th Chapter 20, 21. And the Firſt of theſe Succeſſive Kingdoms <hi>in the 7th Chapter</hi> before the <hi>Perſian,</hi> muſt then be the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> which the <hi>Perſian</hi> conquered. For there were no other two great Kingdoms in thoſe times in a ſucceſſive order to one another, before the <hi>Graecian</hi> Conqueſt, called <hi>the Third, pag.</hi> 107. <hi>&amp; chap.</hi> 2. 39.</p>
                     <p>The whole number alſo of the Four Kingdoms <hi>in the 7th Chapter,</hi> ſeem to be plainly for no other end, but only to meaſure out the time of the laſt Kingdom of the Saints, about which all the concern of that Prophecy is, as may be ſeen at the 17th and 18th verſes: where after the Interpreting Angel had ſaid<hi>—Theſe Great Beaſts are Four Kings—</hi>without mentioning any thing of them, he adds<hi>—But the Saints of the Moſt High ſhall take tbe Kingdom, and poſſeſs it for ever—</hi>Wherefore, ſince the Three laſt of theſe Kingdoms are found to be the ſame with thoſe in the 2d Chapter about the ſame concern <hi>(pag.</hi> 123. <hi>&amp;</hi> 126.) and all the Five are the ſame number in the whole with the number of theſe here, for the ſame end; and are prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of in the ſame Reign of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, which is the firſt of them <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter, v.</hi> 38. and ſo could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin before that time. There ſeems to be no manner of doubt, but that they are all the ſame Four in both Chapters. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would have been a plain ground laid down for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion in this Chapter alſo, about the moſt momentous things that can concern the Church of God, as has been obſerved.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Objections againſt the making the Third Kingdom in the</hi> 2<hi>d and 7th of</hi> Daniel, <hi>the whole time of one Ruling Nation, anſwered.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is <hi>unanimouſly</hi> agreed amongſt the Interpreters of all Parties, and Intereſts, That the Four Kingdoms in the 2d and 7th Chapters of <hi>Daniel,</hi> are the ſame particular Kingdoms, how differing ſoever they are from one another in the particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of them.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo as <hi>generally</hi> agreed amongſt them, that the two firſt of theſe Kingdoms in each Chapter, are the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Monarchies; But about the Third Kingdom in each Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though acknowledged to be the Scheme of one and the ſame Dominion, there is not the ſame conſent for the <hi>particular</hi> application of it.</p>
                     <p>At the firſt mention of a difference, one would be apt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire what ſhould make any one ſceptical in this matter, who affirms the other Two before this Third, to be known Kingdoms, and that all the Four do immediately ſucceed one another, as has been obſerved to be acknowledged by all Parties. For all that ſeems needful to be done for ſuch an ones ſatisfaction, is to deſire him to enquire, what Kingdom it was of the ſame kind and nature with the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy (acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the firſt and ſecond) that came immediately after the Second of theſe Kingdoms, or the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy. Since the Second is granted by all to be the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, from the time of its firſt great appearance in the World at its Conqueſt of the <hi>Babylonian;</hi> who would not forthwith conclude, that the Third muſt be that whole Monarchy which ſubdued the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> and ſucceeded in its room, that is, the whole <hi>Graecian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy?</p>
                     <p>This being the natural and obvious determination about it, and according to the <hi>common Rule</hi> of reading the ſenſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of Scripture, <hi>that is,</hi> from the known uſe of them in the Context; it would be imagined, that there muſt certainly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:204884:88"/> be ſome very great appearing neceſſity, that could make <hi>Grotius,</hi> and ſome others of this laſt Age, to judge the Third Kingdom in both Chapters to be of quite another nature, than thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, were; eſpecially ſince it is againſt the ſenſe of all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, who have been found from St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to have been <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> agreed in making this Third, as well as all the reſt, to be the Succeſſive Rule of an whole Nation.</p>
                     <p>The Opinion of theſe Innovators about the Third Kingdom, is, <hi>That it is the ſingle Reign of</hi> Alexander the Great; <hi>and that the Fourth Kingdom in both Chapters is the diviſion of the</hi> Greek <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy amongſt his Ten Captains immediately after him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Reaſons that they rely upon for this new Opinion, againſt all the ſeeming Abſurdities that attend it, are chiefly theſe that follow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe, if the Third Kingdom in the 2d and 7th of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> were the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy, then the Fourth muſt be the <hi>Roman,</hi> which conquered the <hi>Graecians;</hi> and then the Kingdom of the Son of Man (Chap. 7.) which comes after the Fourth Kingdom there, muſt not begin till after the end of all <hi>Roman</hi> Dominion upon Earth: and this is ſuppoſed to give too great an advantage to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to conclude, that Chriſt Jeſus, at his firſt appearance, could not be the King <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or the Son of Man in his Kingdom. For he died about the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, after the compleat Conqueſt of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Objection will be thought to be much ſtrengthened from the Prophecies that our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, have given out about the time of the coming of the Son of Man, which ſeems to repreſent it to be the advancement of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church in the World, by the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> its Enemies, in that very Age when thoſe Prophecies were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and therefore could not agree with the coming of the Son of Man in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> if the Fourth Kingdom there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kingdom of the Son of Man, were the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Again, If the Fourth Kingdom in <hi>Daniel</hi> were the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, then the Little Horn in that Kingdom would be the ſame with the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> as appears from the exact agreement of the Characters of them both compared together. But it is thought impoſſible that the Little Horn, and the Beaſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:204884:89"/> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſhould be the ſame. For the Little Horn was <note place="margin">Dan. VIII.</note> not to ariſe till the Fourth Kingdom was broken into Ten King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Three of which it was to ſubdue, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 8. Whereas the time of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> muſt neceſſarily have been ſoon after that that Prophecy was given, which was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſuch diviſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: It is ſaid both at the beginning, and at the end of the Book, <hi>That the time of thoſe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 1, 3.</note> 
                        <hi>things was at hand;</hi> and that they <hi>ſhould ſhortly come to paſs,</hi> and <hi>ſhould ſhortly be done.</hi> And to make this unqueſtionable, The <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 6, 7, 10.</note> Prophet is commanded at the end of the Prophecy, <hi>not to ſeal the Saying of the Prophecy of that Book,</hi> becauſe <hi>the time was at hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is moſt agreeable to the Event, and to the other parts of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to make the Fourth Kingdom to be the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Succeſſors. For it has Ten Kings ariſing out of it, to ſignify that variety of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that his Captains did ſet up after his death; And after theſe Ten, is there a Little Horn repreſented, almoſt every way the ſame in every Character of it with the Little Horn in the 8th Chapter, which all agree to be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> one of the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the firſt of theſe Reaſons there is nothing to force a <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                        </label> man againſt what is but the <hi>moſt probable</hi> ſenſe of the words, much leſs what has ſeemed to be the <hi>neceſſary</hi> ſenſe of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it can be proved to be impoſſible, that the Kingdom of the Son of Man in that place ſhould be any thing but the <hi>firſt coming</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> But our Saviour has put us out of all fear of that. For he makes uſe of thoſe very words to ſet out his <hi>ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> after his death, as may be ſeen in all the Goſpels that mention that Prophecy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 30. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 27.</p>
                     <p>We may alſo be well aſſured, that <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf could not poſſibly underſtand that <hi>Eternal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Kingdom of the Son of Man, of his <hi>firſt coming.</hi> For in his 9th Chapter he ſets out the <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Meſſias</hi> by name, as delivered up at his firſt coming into his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, and cut off, and his City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple as deſtroyed by them; which is quite contrary to ſuch a glorious Kingdom, as he is deſcribed in the 7th Chapter to enjoy to all eternity; and which was at its firſt appearance to deſtroy a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that ruled over all the Earth, and was contrary to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:204884:89"/> 2. The 2d Reaſon is of much the ſame force with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <note place="margin">Dan. VII.</note> For though the Terms of the coming of the Son of Man, and of his Kingdom, ſhould be found to be uſed by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and his Apoſtles (in ſome peculiar circumſtances, and by way of alluſion) to ſignify the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet that it cannot be ſo underſtood in this 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe it has ſuch peculiar circumſtances there joined with it, as do always ſignify the laſt coming of Chriſt to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as may be ſeen more at large in the proof of the <hi>14th Propoſition.</hi> But it has alſo been found, that that place in the Goſpels which ſeems to have the greateſt ſtrength in it, to ſhew that the coming of the Son of Man, is to be underſtood of his coming only to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> muſt neceſſarily ſignify his laſt coming to judgment. See this Book, Chap. 2. the five laſt Pages.</p>
                     <p>There are indeed ſome Exhortations of our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, to Perſons then living, to watch againſt the day of the Lord's coming, as if it were to be in that Age. But that can be no aſſurance of it. For there are the ſame kind of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in places, which are by all acknowledged to belong to Chriſt's laſt coming to judgment only: As <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51, 52. 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 4. 15, 17. The reaſon, and application of which laſt, is given in the following Chapter from the 1ſt to the 7th verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of the uncertainty of the time of the Lord's Coming.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The conſequence of the Third Reaſon may ſafely be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, <hi>viz.</hi> That then the Beaſt with the Little Horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi> muſt be the ſame with the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> For it has already been ſufficiently demonſtrated ſo to be in the proof of the <hi>15th Propoſition, Coroll.</hi> 2. And as for the inconſiſtency of thoſe Expreſſions in the firſt and laſt Chapters of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> with the riſe and continuance of the Little Horn in <hi>Daniel;</hi> it is anſwered by the ſtrength of the <hi>15th Propoſition, and Corol.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. And by the familiar uſe of ſuch kind of Expreſſions (as thoſe of the <hi>time being at hand,</hi> and the <hi>doing things ſhortly,</hi> and of their <hi>coming to paſs very ſhortly)</hi> to denote only the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a ſcene of Action within a little while, which requires a long time to finiſh it. As may be ſeen in particular inſtances in the Anſwer to the Objection againſt the <hi>20th Propoſition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:204884:90"/>
                     <p> That which does the moſt manifeſtly evidence, how little thoſe that raiſe this Objection do believe it themſelves, is, that they all allow the <hi>Thouſand years</hi> in the 20th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to be literally underſtood, which is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that the <hi>ſhort time,</hi> and the <hi>time being at hand,</hi> and the <hi>coming ſhortly to paſs,</hi> cannot poſſibly be underſtood of the laſt completion of the things in that Prophecy; and therefore that it can ſignify no more, than that they ſhould <hi>ſhortly begin</hi> to be fulfilled; as it is uſually ſaid of long continuance of time, that it is <hi>at hand,</hi> or that it will <hi>ſhortly come,</hi> to ſignify that it will <hi>ſhortly begin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. All the ſtrength of the laſt Objection lies in the likeneſs of the Little Horn in the <hi>7th Chapter,</hi> to that in the <hi>8th Chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But who could ever take the Two Little Horns in the <hi>7th and 8th Chapters,</hi> to be ſo very like one another, that has but the leaſt patience to conſider them impartially? It is ſo plain, that the Little Horn in the 8th Chapter muſt be <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that it is <hi>generally</hi> agreed upon by almoſt all kind of Interpreters: But it is as plain, that the other in the 7th Chapter is ſucceeded by an Eternal, Univerſal Kingdom of the Son of Man, which <note place="margin">v. 27.</note> is called the <hi>Greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven.</hi> Now was there any thing ever like this in the times immediately after the death of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who was near 200 years before Chriſt? or any thing like it at the end of the Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> many years after it, which was above 60 years before the birth of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>And therefore do we find <hi>Grotius</hi> at ſuch a pinch to reconcile theſe Inconſiſtencies, that he is forced to interpret the <hi>Son of Man</hi> to ſignify in this place the <hi>Roman Nation:</hi> Whereas the name of the Son of man, in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> was ſo generally known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews to ſignify the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that the High-prieſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately rent his Cloaths when he heard our Saviour making himſelf known by that name; and he and they forthwith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded him guilty of Blaſphemy, becauſe they took him but for an ordinary Perſon, as has been before obſerved in the proof of the <hi>13th Propoſition.</hi> And nothing can more demonſtrate the hardineſs of <hi>Grotius</hi> for the defence of a ſingular Opinion, than to ſee him venture at ſo likely a danger of Blaſphemy to maintain his poſt.</p>

                        </note> the moſt Eminent of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> tho' it be more for their Intereſt than any others, that the fourth Kingdom were any thing rather than the <hi>Roman;</hi> which does ſufficiently ſhew that they are forced to allow it: For they can have no manner of advantage from that conceſſion, and therefore muſt it be the impartial ſenſe of their minds; but it would ſave them a great deal of trouble to deny it, if they fairly could; and that ſhews the evidence for it to be too clear: And this gives as ſtrong a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption againſt the poſſibility of any other ſenſe, as can almoſt be given from Authority.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore well worth the enquiry, What might be the grounds of ſo univerſal and impartial an Agreement, amongſt all the differing Parties of all ſorts, about this third and fourth Kingdom.</p>

                              <hi>Ibid.</hi> That ought to be obſerved, that the Prophet ſaw the Third Beaſt with Four Heads upon him; And the He-Goat (Chap. 8.) after the firſt Horn was broken, to have had Four in the room of it, to make it <hi>clear, and unqueſtionable,</hi> That the He-Goat, and the Third Beaſt were but one and the ſame thing.</p>
                        </note> is the plain intimations in the Prophecy, That the third Kingdom is the <note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> whole time of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> from the <hi>Perſians</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi>

It is againſt all the ſignifications of Kingdoms beſides, that are repreſented by any whole Figures in this Book of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi> and the common uſage of Prophetical Terms, eſpecially in the ſame Book, is the beſt Rule to determine their ſignification, <hi>by Rule</hi> 2. Now, by the confeſſion of theſe men themſelves, and the unanimous conſent of all Interpreters, every <hi>whole</hi> Figure that is ſaid to ſignifie a Kingdom, does ſignifie <hi>the whole</hi> time of a Ruling Nation or People. In that one conſtant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, we find it in no leſs than <hi>Ten</hi> diſtinct Figures, not counting in this third Kingdom. There are eight mentioned, beſides the third, in the 2d and 7th Chapters, and two in the 8th; for the Kingdom of the <hi>Stone,</hi> and of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:204884:91"/> are two of thoſe Schemes: So that there is at leaſt Ten to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt it,</hi> That the third Kingdom is the whole time of the Monarchy of the <hi>Greeks</hi> after the <hi>Perſians.</hi> And that which appears to be the conſtant uſe of expreſſions in ſo wiſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious a Writer, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> was, may be very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely relied upon, as an unqueſtionable ground to determine his meaning, whenever the ſame expreſſion is uſed in any other place, in which it is not ſo clearly known. <hi>Rule</hi> 2, 3.</p>

It is againſt all the other known repreſentations of the different kinds of Supreme Powers in the ſame Nation all over <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that they ſhould have two diſtinct Figures to repreſent two different kinds of them, even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Interpretation of theſe men themſelves. For all the differences of Supreme Powers in the ſame Nation every-where elſe, are granted to be ſet out by the parts or appurtenances of whole Figures: As, <hi>in the 8th Chapter,</hi> that which repreſents the Succeſſion of the <hi>Perſian</hi> after the <hi>Median</hi> Kings, in the ſame Nation of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> is the Two Horns of the Ram, not <hi>two different Beaſts.</hi> And the four diviſions of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, with the Rule of the firſt King, are ſet out by four Horns, after one great Horn, which belonged all to the one He-Goat. The Ten Kings ariſing out of the fourth Kingdom, and the One after them, are repreſented by eleven Horns of one and the ſame Beaſt, <hi>in Chap.</hi> 7. 24. And the ſame Ten Kings in the fourth Kingdom of the Image, <hi>in the</hi> 2<hi>d Chapter,</hi> are ſhewn by the Ten Toes of the Feet. The Seven ſucceſſive Kings alſo of the Kingdom in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and the Ten Kings, who are all at a time in that <hi>Roman</hi> Rule, are repreſented by the Seven Heads and Ten Horns of that One Beaſt. All which, if counted up together, will be found to be the odds of above Forty to <hi>Nothing,</hi> againſt the dividing of the ſingle Reign of <hi>Alexander,</hi> from thoſe who ſucceeded him in the ſame Nation, and againſt the repreſenting him by one <hi>whole</hi> Figure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Third Kingdom is certainly that which ſucceeded the Second; and the Second by all is agreed to ſignifie the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kingdom; and what a kind of Kingdom it was that ſucceeded the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the Prophet himſelf informs us <hi>in the 8th Chapter;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 21, 22.</note> where the <hi>King of Greece,</hi> who overthrew the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, does ſignifie the <hi>whole</hi> time of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, with a firſt Conquering King in it, and a four-fold Kingdom after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:204884:92"/> him. And therefore here alſo muſt this Third Kingdom, that ſucceeded the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and is repreſented in this 7th Chapter by One Beaſt, as that was in the Eighth, be the ſame time of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy from its Conqueſt of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to the end of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The proper Character of the Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> (which <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Reign was but a part of) is a Kingdom firſt under <hi>one</hi> King, then divided into <hi>four,</hi> and joyned together in one Figure, as appears in the 8th and 11th Chapters, where <note place="margin">v. 8. v. 4.</note> the Kingdom of the firſt King is ſaid to be <hi>divided towards the four winds of Heaven</hi> in both thoſe Chapters. Wherefore ſince the Third Kingdom in the 7th Chapter is ſhown by a <hi>Leopard</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>with four Heads, and four Wings</hi> (to make ſure of the number Four) If that be <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Kingdom, it muſt be his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom divided into four; and then it is the ſame with the whole <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy ſetled in the four laſting Kingdoms of it, mentioned as the one Kingdom <hi>in the 8th and 11th Chapters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Beſides, that the Leopard with the four Heads, and four Wings, muſt ſignify ſuch a divided Kingdom, appears from all the ſignifications of Heads and Horns; and all the parts of Figures ſignifying Dominion in any place elſe of this Book, and of that of the Revelations. As in the 8th Chapter twice; in the 2d Chapter, in the feet and toes (the ſame with the fourth Beaſt and his Ten Horns in the 7th Chapter) pag. 104, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which alſo are Ten Kings in one Kingdom; and the Ten Horns of the Beaſt in the Revelations, are of the ſame ſignification, <hi>Prop.</hi> 15. So that the Leopard being granted by all to be a <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Kingdom, there is at leaſt <hi>Five to nothing clear to the contrary,</hi> that the four-headed Leopard is <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Kingdom divided into four, which we know to be the fourfold Monarchy of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. If <hi>Alexander</hi>'s ſingle Reign were the Third Kingdom ſhown by the Third Beaſt in the 7th Chapter, and his Ten Captains immediately after him were a fourth Kingdom ſhown by the Fourth Beaſt with Ten Horns; then that Kingdom, which was repreſented but as <hi>One</hi> and <hi>the ſame</hi> in the 8th and 11th Chapters of the ſame Prophet, would be repreſented as One and Three.</p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:204884:92"/>
                     <p> For there would be one Kingdom under <hi>Alexander</hi> alone, ſhewn by the Third Beaſt, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. Another under his Ten Captains, ſhown by the Fourth Beaſt; and a Third by the fourfold Kingdom of the four Horns of the He-Goat in the 8th Chapter: And thus <hi>one</hi> Kingdom ſhown by <hi>one</hi> Beaſt <hi>only</hi> in the 8th Chapter, ſhould be <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms ſhown by two Beaſts in the 7th Chapter, and a <hi>Third</hi> Kingdom beſides, ſhown by a part only of that one Beaſt in the 8th Chapter, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the whole time of them all; which would ſuppoſe that the Prophet had no conſiſtency at all with himſelf in his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; but that he did ſet them down at all adventures in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to one another: And this alſo muſt be ſuppoſed of him without the leaſt plain ground from any thing that he had ſaid to countenance it; which is a ſufficient warrant to make us determine, that all this is more than theſe Men have any ground to affirm of him, and contrary to what he is every where repreſented, <hi>viz.</hi> As a very profound wiſe Man; and even contrary to all the experience that we have of it in all the Figures, which are granted to be known, wherein he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by All to obſerve a conſtant and determinate uſage of them in <hi>one only</hi> ſignification.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Again, when we ſee the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy after <hi>Alexander</hi> repreſented as a fourfold Kingdom in known and plain terms in the 8th and 11th Chapters, to make the next Kingdom after him to be a tenfold Kingdom of his Captains in the 7th Chapter, is to ſhut ones eyes againſt what the Prophet had plainly ſaid in thoſe two Chapters: And which he ſeems openly to refer to by the four Heads of the Leopard. And what a ſtrange contempt of a Propheſy is it, to reject a Figure of a Kingdom, that has juſt the ſame marks that it is ſet out with in two open known places which expreſly name it, and to take up with another in the ſtead of it, that has ſuch marks as that Kingdom was never before ſet out with by the Prophet? That is, to paſs by the Leopard with the four Heads (which yet is granted to be a part of the Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 8th and 11th Chapters, by their own confeſſion) and inſtead of it, to chuſe a Beaſt with Ten Horns repreſenting ten Kingdoms for the reſt of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, which had before been <hi>twice</hi> called a fourfold Kingdom; but never a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with Ten Kings in it?</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:204884:93"/> 9. The Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> we ſee were wrote by himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9, 10. As <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms of him alſo from the Ancients; and he did not conclude them till after the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy was begun under <hi>Cyrus, chap.</hi> 10. 1. So that he lived under the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchies, and names them both, <hi>and the Graecian:</hi> And he Prophecies of the whole <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy in particular under the Figure of a Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. as is by all granted.</p>
                     <p>When therefore we find in the 7th Chapter, juſt before the 8th, the mention of three Kingdoms ſucceeding one another, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by three Beaſts, The Two firſt of which the Prophet knew to be the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchies, (as all do grant) What ground in the world have we to queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he means by the third Beaſt, or third Kingdom, the whole <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy from its Conqueſt of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> ſince it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that in the very next Chapter after this 7th, he foretells that whole Monarchy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> under the Figure of a Beaſt? There is certainly more ground from the Prophecy to conclude, that he means by the third Beaſt in the 7th Chapter, the <hi>whole</hi> time of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy from its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> than that by the firſt of the three muſt be meant the whole <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy. For the <hi>Babylonian</hi> is not any where elſe ſaid, by name, to be repreſented under the Figure of a Beaſt, as the <hi>Grecian</hi> is in the 8th Chapter, immediately after.</p>
                     <p>We have reaſon therefore to be confident, that the Prophet, that underſtands by the firſt and ſecond Beaſts, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchies to <hi>their laſt end,</hi> cannot by the third un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>only a part</hi> of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy after the <hi>Perſian;</hi> and by the fourth, the remaining <hi>part of it.</hi> And if men may be allowed thus to diſregard all examples of the ſignifications of things of the ſame nature, they may chuſe any interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they can fancy; and with the ſame freedom may they maintain, That by the firſt Beaſt is meant the ſingle perſon of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> alone; and by the ſecond, another Conqueror ſome Hundreds of years after; and by the third, <hi>Pompey;</hi> and by the fourth, what they pleaſe: If they may interpret one of theſe Figures to be a ſingle perſon, There is as much reaſon to make them all of the ſame kind: And to affirm any thing thus <hi>at all adventures,</hi> without any regard to the known ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204884:93"/> of the ſame kind, is both againſt all the Rules of any other Interpretations of Scripture, and takes away all manner of hopes of being able to determine the ſenſe of any Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. To this may be added, That the Order, and Time of the ſeveral Viſions, do confirm this Application of the four Beaſts in the 7th Chapter, to the four ſucceeding Monarchies from the Prophets time.</p>
                     <p>For as theſe four Beaſts have been found to be the ſame with the four Kingdoms in the 2d Chapter (Page 104, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> ſo does it appear from the time of the firſt of them in the 2d Chapter, compared with that of the firſt in the 7th, That they muſt be both the whole <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, not any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Reign; becauſe that in the 2d is applied to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and that in the 7th was ſeen in the time of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> after the death of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and therefore muſt the firſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in both Chapters ſignify an Empire common to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> and thoſe that came after him; That is, the <hi>whole</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Now the 8th Chapter, whoſe viſion was after that in the 7th Chapter, aſſures us by the ſame kind of Figures, <hi>viz.</hi> by Two Beaſts, That the two next Kingdoms are the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchies <hi>by name,</hi> to the time of <hi>their laſt end:</hi> And when the Prophet had thus ſeen afterwards the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchies repreſented by the Figures of Two Beaſts, Can it be with any manner of Reaſon thought, that he could Judge the 2d and 3d Beaſt in the 7th Chapter, to be any other Kingdoms, than thoſe very ſame, which he had in the 8th Chapter ſeen repreſented by the ſame kind of Figures, and which were made known to him to be Kingdoms, that ſhould ſucceed in order to the firſt in the 7th Chapter, and which he knew in the time of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by his own experience, was verified of the <hi>Perſian?</hi> Eſpecially if it be conſidered, that there is not the leaſt intimation from him, to make any think the ſecond and third Kingdoms in the 7th Chapter, to be different things from the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Kingdoms, <hi>known by name,</hi> in the 8th Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It is impoſſible, That the fourth Kingdom in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſhould be a Kingdom of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> becauſe it was to be conſumed by the Kingdom <hi>of the Son of Man</hi> in the 2d Chap.

                     <p>That the four firſt whole Figures in the 2d and 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> are the <hi>Babylonian, Perſian, Graecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchies; And that the laſt Kingdom in each, ſignified by the <hi>Stone,</hi> and the Figure of the Appearance of the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> is the Rule of God's Church, or of the People of God; and then the two Figures in the 8th Chapter, are known to be the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies; And thus we find the firſt part of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly aſſured, <hi>That not only the Figure of a Beaſt, but any other</hi>

The four Wings alſo, and the four Heads of the <hi>Leopard</hi> in the 7th Chapter, ſhew us the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in that Monarchy. The ten Horns of the Fourth Beaſt do repreſent the diviſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy into Ten Kingdoms; for they are repreſented as being all up at the ſame time with the Little Horn.

                     <p>It appears alſo from the four Heads of the Leopard, and the <label type="milestone">

                     <p>For though the <hi>Perſian</hi> Rule was in the ſame Nation of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> with that of the King of <hi>Media,</hi> yet becauſe he had <hi>the name</hi> of the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> inſtead of the King of <hi>Media,</hi> he is repreſented by a <hi>new Horn</hi> of the ſame Beaſt. Many other differences were there in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Line, as different Families, different behaviour to the Church of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all theſe made no change of that Horn for any other; and the ſame may be obſerved by the Horns of the He Goat in the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, where, though there were many other accidental Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences amongſt the ſingle Perſons comprehended under the ſame Horn, yet they continue notwithſtanding but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Horn.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo apparent from the Figure of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy, that <hi>it is the</hi> continuing Settlement <hi>of a Form of Government, which</hi>

                        <hi>makes it an Head, or Horn, or a change of the Government of the body of a Nation.</hi> Thus we ſee it was in the four Horns of the Leopard,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204884:96"/> and He Goat, which did ſignify the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy when it came to <hi>a ſetled</hi> appearance of four Kingdoms; whereas there was nothing to repreſent the continued Scuffles of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains before that <hi>ſetled</hi> Form of the Monarchy.</p>

                        <hi>under all the ſingle Perſons that are in the poſſeſſion of them after one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is certain from the continuance of the ſeveral Horns, and the Little Horn on the Fourth Beaſt, till the time of the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of Man; And alſo from the time of the Little Horn in the 8th Chapter, which is ſaid to be in the latter time of the Kingdom of the four Horns: For before the time of that <note place="margin">v. 25.</note> Little Horn, there had been many Succeſſions of ſingle Perſons in each of the four Kingdoms, that is, in the Ruling time of each of the Horns.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we may now moſt certainly conclude, That the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> is every-where conſtant to it ſelf in the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of every one of its Figures, and that there is but <hi>one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſignification</hi> of the Prophetical Figures <hi>of the ſame kind</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Book; and therefore may one thereupon conclude with ſtill more aſſurance, That</p>

                           <hi>And in both theſe kinds do the ſeveral Heads, or Horns, ſignify the continuance of that Government, or divided Kingdom, to their laſt End.</hi>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204884:98"/> latter part of the <hi>Revelations:</hi> ſince it has been already found, that all thoſe peculiar Figures of Empire, and Sovereignty, and the particular Phraſes and Style belonging to them in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> are juſt the ſame with thoſe of the like kind in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and are not ſo diſtinctly to be found in any other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets beſides.</p>
                     <p>But the undoubted confirmation of this, is the aſſurance that we have of the <hi>15th Propoſition.</hi> For by that it appears, That <hi>the Beaſt in the</hi> Revelations <hi>is the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th of</hi> Daniel, and that it has the ſame, and that a very great many moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Characters and Expreſſions attributed to it, by which that Beaſt in <hi>Daniel</hi> is deſcribed.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>There need no more be ſaid for the proof of this, than that the Seven Heads are ſaid to ſucceed in this order, <hi>Five, one, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. to ſhew them to be ſucceſſive, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. and that the Ten Kings are deſcribed as acting all together with the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>For according to the ſignification of a Beaſt, and its Heads and Horns, with theſe Characters in <hi>Daniel,</hi> they muſt ſignify ſo many ſucceſſive Sovereign Powers, and ſo many divided, diſtinct Kingdoms of one and the ſame Nation, <hi>by Prop.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>And the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> is the chief Example of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uſe of Beaſts, and their Parts, and to which all the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> are found to refer, <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> 15.—And the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> is certainly ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Rule, <hi>by Prop.</hi> 6.—Therefore by <hi>Rule the</hi> 2<hi>d,</hi> The Beaſt, its Heads, and Horns, do ſignify the Rule of the <hi>Romans</hi>

                     <p>But it may poſſibly be pretended, that there are clear grounds in the <hi>Revelations</hi> againſt the making the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> a Rule of Interpretation for the Figures in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> For the Figures in the <hi>Revelations</hi> have a different uſe from thoſe in <hi>Daniel.</hi> For example,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are three ſeveral ſhows of one and the ſame <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and following immediately one after another from the 12th to the 18th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations;</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the uſe of ſuch ſucceſſion of Figures in <hi>Daniel,</hi> muſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify three ſeveral Ruling Nations; <hi>Prop.</hi> 16. Beſides, that one of theſe three Beaſts is expreſly deſcribed in ſucceſſion to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Chap. 13. 2.

                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed is more ingenuous; he owns the known Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Beaſts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that the fourth of the 7th Chapter is in particular the ſame with that in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and from the certainty of both does acknowledge, that the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> does ſignify in general the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and that the Heads of the Beaſt muſt be all Heads of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that the time of that called the Beaſt, is not yet paſt.

                           <p>If it ſhould be objected, That the <hi>Triumviri Rep. Conſtituendae,</hi> were as different a Government from all theſe, it is to be conſidered, that that was only the Rule of three ſingle Men for one turn only; And ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are no-where made an Head of a Beaſt. That of the firſt Horn in the 8th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is the King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> or <hi>Alexander,</hi> and his Heirs. <hi>Fene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtella</hi> does alſo reject this as no Magiſtracy, <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</p>
                           <p>And theſe two forms of theſe Governments, which are the moſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Decemvirs,</hi> and the <hi>Dictators,</hi> have a very ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for them from the beſt approved Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs. <hi>Livy</hi> ſays of the <hi>Decemvirs,</hi> Book the IIId, in the 300th and firſt year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> The Government of the City was changed from <hi>Conſuls</hi> to <hi>Decemvirs,</hi> as it had been before from <hi>Kings</hi> to <hi>Conſuls.</hi> And <hi>Feneſtella</hi> of the <hi>Dictators,</hi> chap. 8. of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtracy,—that they were ſo much the <hi>Supream Power</hi> of the Commonwealth, that there was no Appeal from them; and that they had the power of the Lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and the entire Juriſdiction of the whole Commonwealth;—And that He was called the Maſter of the People for his Abſolute Power.</p>
                        </note> by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſar,</hi> and by <hi>Ribera,</hi> in expreſs words, who ſays, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire is now at an end.</p>
                     <p>Therefore is it that <hi>Grotius</hi> is ſo higly applauded for that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterpiece of his, in confounding the acceptation of a Beaſt, and its Horns, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> by denying the fourth Beaſt in the 7th Chapter to be a Rule of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is the only true way to ſtrike at the root of any ſetled Interpretation of the Beaſt, or its Heads, in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> But then we ſee it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to run into a greater abſurdity than any of theſe to maintain it, as his Opinion about the coming of the Son of Man has been already made to appear. And there need no other proof of the falſeneſs of his Interpretation of the Heads of the Beaſt, than to be ſatisfied, that the coming of the Son of Man in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is the Kingdom of Chriſt. For that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes ſuch an uniform acceptation of the ſignification of the Heads, and Horns of a Beaſt all over <hi>Daniel,</hi> as makes his new contrivance about the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> to be againſt all the conſtant Prophetical uſe of them.</p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:204884:100"/>
                     <p> From hence then it does ſufficiently appear, That the ſeven Heads of the Beaſt are ſo many Sovereign Powers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy; and becauſe they are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>five, paſt</hi> at the time of the Viſion, <hi>one</hi> then in being, and <hi>others to come,</hi> it is certain alſo, that they are ſucceſſive; and therefore by <hi>Propoſition the 16th—</hi>are they as many Changes of the Sovereign Power of that Empire, as there are Succeſſions amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>By almoſt all Proteſtant Interpreters, are theſe ſeven Heads de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be at <hi>leaſt ſeven</hi> Succeſſions of the Sovereign Power of <hi>Rome.</hi> But becauſe there is no abſolutely certain aſſurance of more than <hi>three</hi> ſucceſſive Changes from the Text, of which the ſixth is the firſt Succeſſion (there ſignified by <hi>five</hi> are paſt, <hi>one</hi> is.) All that can therefore be poſitively affirmed about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſucceſſive Ruling Powers, is, That the three laſt are certainly ſucceſſive Changes of the Ruling Power of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>I diſpute not here the ſucceſſive Rule of the firſt five Heads, but rather judge it to be highly probable, that they are the five different Changes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government that are ordinarily accounted upon. <note n="e" place="margin">

                           <p>—But neither was the Commonwealth governed always by the ſame Heads.

                           </p>
                           <p>But if any will further contend to have the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>Interreges,</hi> and the <hi>Triumviri Reipublic.

                        </note> The <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians do reckon up the Changes of their Government in that order; <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontifice,</hi> does reckon up the ſame number of the Governments of <hi>Rome.</hi> But yet it ſeems not to be plainly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, that the five firſt Heads may not have been all five in Rule at the ſame time before the ſixth, or at leaſt not certain, but that they might have ſucceeded by more than one ſingle Head at a time. As in the He-Goat in the 8th Chapter of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> it might be ſaid that there was one Horn firſt, and four more after it, where there is a ſucceſſion of five Horns, and yet but one ſucceſſive Change of the Ruling Power of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> that is, The diviſion of that Monarchy into four, after the time of the ſingle Reign of one King over it.</p>

                           </p>
                        </note> And next, That they do reign <hi>in an immediate ſucceſſive</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, does appear from the Number of the Laſt, which is ſaid to be the Eighth. Whereas, if there had been any more than Two betwixt the Five, that were then ſaid to be paſt, and this which is called the Eighth, this Laſt would have been more than an Eighth, according to the number of thoſe that had come in betwixt the Five and the Laſt, beſides thoſe Two that are mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This is further confirmed by the uſe of Numbers in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which denote the Succeſſion of Ruling Powers. As in the four Kingdoms repreſented by the four Metals in the Statue, Ch. 2. and ſignified to ſucceed one another; every Kingdom does <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly</hi> ſucceed that before it. So alſo do the four Kingdoms in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> follow one another in an <hi>immediate</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 15. lib. 2.</note> order. The Two Horns of the Ram in the 8th Chapter, one of which is ſaid to come up after the other, are known to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the <hi>immediate</hi> Succeſſion of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Government to that under the <hi>Median</hi> Kings. The fourth King of <hi>Perſia</hi> after <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the 11th Chapter, v. 2. is known to be <hi>Xerxes</hi> in an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> Succeſſion from <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Succeſſion of the firſt King, and of the four after him, ſignified by the Horns of the He-Goat in the 8th Chapter, may indeed ſeem to be an exception to the reſt, becauſe the <hi>quadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite</hi> Diviſion of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy did not <hi>immediately</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Reign of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then neither is there any number there uſed to denote an <hi>immediate</hi> Succeſſion; There is no mention of a <hi>firſt,</hi> and a <hi>ſecond</hi> King, but only of a <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>four Kings</hi> after him, which does not exclude the intervening of others betwixt them, as the name of a firſt, or ſecond, would do.</p>
                     <p>And yet, if it be well conſidered, The <hi>Quadripartite</hi> Diviſion of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy was ſo much the <hi>immediate</hi> next form of the Supream Rule of it to the Heirs of <hi>Alexander;</hi> that there was no other <hi>ſetled</hi> Diviſion of that Monarchy that came in between them; and that one would eſteem to be ground enough to call it the <hi>next immediate</hi> ſucceſſive form of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, when there was no other <hi>ſetled</hi> form betwixt the Reign of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Heirs, and the fourfold Diviſion of the Empire.</p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:204884:103"/>
                     <p> Again, The Beaſt is never without one of his Heads, even in the time of his Ten Horns to his laſt ruine, by <hi>Coroll.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. Wherefore upon the falling of one of his Heads, the next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt immediately ariſe, or elſe the Beaſt would be without an Head, and ſo without any life in it. For the Ten Horns, from whence alone it could be ſuppoſed to have any life beſides, are all in the time of the Laſt Head, by <hi>Coroll.</hi> 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>But ſtill further, it may eaſily be perceived, That the three laſt Kings are ſet down in order by the Angel, for no other end, but to ſhew the time of the riſe of the Eighth, called the Beaſt, and which is the only Subject-matter of all the Viſions.</p>
                     <p>To confirm this, it is plain, That there is none of the whole number of theſe Kings, but only the Eighth, who have any thing more mentioned of them, than barely the number, that they are known by, and the order in which they lie from that preſent time, when theſe things were ſpoken, to the time of the Reign of the Eighth. The Sixth is therefore only ſaid to be the King, that was at that preſent time the Soveraign of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it might be thereby known, how many Succeſſions of the Ruling Power of that Monarchy there was to be from the time of the Viſion to the Reign of the Beaſt. Now if the order of theſe Succeſſions had not been <hi>immediate</hi> to one another, this number would really have ſignified nothing for that Deſign; but would on the contrary have been a moſt certain means of deluding men into a miſtake upon very clear and warrantable grounds for it, eſpecially ſince there is no intimation in the leaſt to incline a man to underſtand it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore by <hi>Rule the firſt,</hi> it may be relied upon, that the Succeſſion of the three laſt Kings of the Eighth in the 17th Chapter, was <hi>immediate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo plainly does this appear to be intimated from the <note place="margin">CONSENT.</note> Text, that it has the almoſt unanimous Conſent of all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Parties of Interpreters. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> indeed has a very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fancy in this point; he would have the Seven Heads, or Kings, to ſignify here <hi>all the Emperours,</hi> becauſe the Number <hi>Seven</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo uſed in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> Whereas nothing is more commonly known, than that when <hi>Seven,</hi> or <hi>Ten,</hi> are divided into broken numbers, as the number <hi>Seven</hi> is here into <hi>Five, One, another,</hi> &amp;c. they are never uſed for a perfect number, or to ſignify <hi>All.</hi> And the mention of the <hi>Eighth,</hi> which was one
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204884:103"/> of the Seven, does plainly aſſure them to be juſt <hi>Seven,</hi> and no more. What more remarkable Inſtance can we have, how extravagantly ſingular a man of good ſenſe, in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, may be upon no manner of tolerable grounds for it?</p>
                     <p>If the three laſt Kings do immediatly ſucceed one another, then it is certain, that</p>
                     <q>The Eighth King is one of the firſt Six returned into Rule again. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Corollary. </seg>

                     </q>
                     <p>For the Eighth King is one of the Seven that were paſt before, returned into Rule again, <hi>Coroll. Prop.</hi> 4. And it cannot be the Seventh, becauſe the three laſt Kings; and therefore the Seventh and Eighth do immediatly ſucceed one another, <hi>Prop.</hi> 18. ſo that if the Eighth were the Seventh, and with the Seventh King it would be but the Seventh continued in being, and therefore not an Eighth. The Eighth King muſt therefore be one of the Six that were paſt before it.</p>
                     <p>It cannot therefore now be doubted, but that</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>The Sixth King of the Eight in the 17th Chapter of the</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <note place="margin">Propoſit. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>was the Imperial Government of</hi> Rome <hi>at the time of the Viſion.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the Sixth King is the Sixth Head of the Beaſt, <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. And an Head or Horn of a Beaſt does in Prophecy ſignify a form of Supream Power in a Nation; And the continuance of that Form, under all the ſingle Perſons that reign in it, till it be changed by another, <hi>Prop.</hi> 16. Now there was no other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Sixth King is ſaid to be in Rule there, but only that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. The Sixth King then muſt be the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours till that was cut off by a Form of Government of another name. <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. <hi>Prop.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be objected, That by the Sixth Head, or King, may be meant but one part of the Imperial Government, or thoſe only that were of the ſame Line or Family, or of the ſame Countrey, or of the ſame Religion, or the like; It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that there is no warrant for any other ſignification of a new Succeſſive Head, or Horn, in the ſame Juriſdiction, than that of a new name of the Governing Power. There were
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:204884:104"/> many other differences in the Succeſſions of the ſeveral Kings of the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchies, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeveral Lines and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, ſeveral different Countries, but yet they were all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under one and the ſame Horn. The only plain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that we have of the change of a ſingle Horn in the ſame Beaſt, which is the ſame with the change of an Head, <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. <hi>Prop.</hi> 16. is that of the Two Horns of the Ram, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. where all the difference betwixt the latter Horn and the firſt, is, that the Laſt was known by the name of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other was called the King of <hi>Media,</hi> in the ſame one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Medes and Perſians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is therefore no warrant for making the Sixth King any thing elſe, but the <hi>whole time</hi> of the Imperial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till it was changed for a <hi>Roman</hi> Government of another name.</p>
                     <p>There is no kind of ſcruple to be made againſt this upon the account of the name of King, which is common to all the Eight Kings. For that is known to be very dubiouſly uſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but eſpecially in Prophecy, to ſignify either a Kingdom, or a Government in a Nation of another kind than the Kingly Government. The moſt certain Example of it is this preſent uſe of the word King, where it muſt at leaſt ſignify an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which is a Government of another denomination; and ſo different from that of Kings, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> which permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the one, are ſaid to have <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hieron. Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus de Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, c.</hi> 13. <hi>Julius Caeſar, &amp;c. Julius Caeſar—</hi>who when he had engroſſed the Dictatorian and Regal Power to himſelf, becauſe he knew that the name of King was hated by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and even execrable to them; to decline the envy of it, inſtead of King, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be called Emperour.—When <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> the Conſul offered him the Diadem, he cried out aloud, that he was <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and not a King, and threw away the Diadem.</note> an hatred for the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Anſwer to this, is, That an Emperour had really the ſame power that a King had; But if that be ſufficient to qualify a Supream Power for the Name or Title of King, Then all the ſeveral different Rulers of the <hi>Roman</hi> State might as well have <note place="margin">See Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> that name, and ſo be comprehended under the Five firſt Kings here mentioned. For the Conſuls are ſaid to have ſucceeded into all the Power and the Authority of the Kings that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; And all the other kinds of Government had the ſame Authority: And though there ſhould be ſome ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:204884:104"/> in the degree of their Authority, yet that is no more, than is to be found betwixt <note n="c" place="margin">

But if any one ſhould think it hard, and forced, that <hi>many Kings</hi> ſhould be ſignified by the name of <hi>one</hi> King, and ſhould think, that theſe ſeven are but ſeven ſingle Kings; let him know in the firſt place, that all Expoſitors have underſtood, that in <hi>every one</hi> of theſe ſeven are comprehended a great many, and that never did any take them to be ſeven ſingle perſons <hi>only,</hi> but <hi>Victorinus,</hi> whoſe Opinion all do deſervedly cry out againſt.—And then <hi>next,</hi> let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that it is not unuſual in Scripture, by <hi>one</hi> King to ſignify <hi>many</hi> of the like ſort, and as it were of one and the ſame Body, which is eſpecially to be obſerved. So in <hi>Daniel</hi> 8. The Ram with the two Horns, does ſignify all the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſucceeding one another in order, and making as it were but one body, who are therefore accounted but as one King.

                     <p>But in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> it is evident, That by the Four Beaſts, called Four Kings, is meant four Kingdoms, and by the Fourth of theſe Kings, the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth.

                     <p>And further, That this Sixth King cannot be any ſingle Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or Emperour, which is the chief thing pretended to by thoſe who will not have it to be the Imperial Government, is moſt evident from this following Conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi> That then the Eighth King, which is the Beaſt, would have been the next ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Emperour but one after him. For the three Laſt Kings do immediatly ſucceed one another by <hi>Prop. praeced.</hi> And then all the Characters and Attendants of the Beaſt muſt have been found verified of the next Emperour but one after the time of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

There muſt then have been Ten Kings, <hi>that had no Kingdom at the time of the Viſion,</hi> who were yet ſuch Maſters of ſo many Kingdoms, in the time of the next Emperour but one to it, as that they ſhould <hi>give their Kingdoms</hi> to that Emperour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12, 13.</p>

                     <p>The Sixth King, or Head, muſt therefore neceſſarily be the Imperial Government of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     </q>
                     <p>For the Beaſt is the Eighth in immediate ſucceſſion to the Sixth, which is the Imperial Government; <hi>Prop.</hi> 19. And it is The Beaſt under one of its Heads, which ſignifies Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under the Succeſſive Reigns of many ſingle Perſons in that Government, <hi>Prop.</hi> 16. Therefore muſt the Beaſt be the next <hi>Roman</hi> Government but one to the Imperial, that Ruled at the time of the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>By the preceding <hi>Propoſition</hi> it appears what Abſurdities and Inconſiſtencies they muſt fall into, who would have the time of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204884:105"/> the Beaſt paſſed over almoſt as ſoon as it began. One would think, that there muſt be ſome great neceſſity that did force to theſe ſtreights; But the chief thing that is alledged for it from this Prophecy, is, That at the beginning of it, it is ſaid, That <hi>the things were ſhortly to come to paſs,</hi> That <hi>the time was at hand:</hi> And again, at the end of it alſo, That <hi>they were things which muſt ſhortly be done;</hi> And that the <hi>Book ſhould not be ſealed, becauſe the time was at hand.</hi> But theſe things have already been ſufficiently conſidered, <hi>pag.</hi> 114. And there is nothing more familiar in Speech, than to ſay of things, that require a great deal of time for the finiſhing them, that they <hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                        <hi>will ſhortly be,</hi> inſtead of, They <note place="margin">See Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> will ſhortly <hi>begin</hi> to be. As one might ſay at <hi>Eaſter, All the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers work will ſhortly be upon us; This Play will be acted preſently, though it be five hours in acting:</hi> So about the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>All things foretold of the times of the Meſſiah will ſhortly come to paſs.</hi> All the pretended neceſſity then, comes now to be none at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> could not have reflected more upon the Judgment of the moſt Eminent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Interpreters, than to think it to be ſo plain, that the time of the Beaſt was long ſince paſt, from ſuch obvious grounds as theſe, and yet that this ſhould never be found out by the moſt Judicious of them; For it would ſave them all that trouble that they have, to make it out that their preſent Church is not concerned in the Affairs of the Beaſt, in which there would be no difficulty, if it were ſo plain, that the time of the Beaſt is long ſince paſt: And beſides, it would keep them from granting ſo much as they do, to the diſadvantage of their Cauſe; whereas, in a concern of this nature, 'tis very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to yield to any thing, but what is neceſſary to be granted; eſpecially ſince what they do yield to, does force them to ſuch contradictions to what they allow to be the known ſignifications of a Beaſt, and its Heads or Horns, in other places, as we ſee in <hi>Ribera, &amp;c.</hi> or to matter of fact, as ſhall be made to appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Bellarmin (Prop.</hi> 22.) who has granted ſo far, as he has laid the whole ſtreſs of the Controverſie betwixt us upon the truth of Hiſtory.</p>

                        <hi>An Head of the Beaſt is that ſetled Sovereign Power of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <note place="margin">Prop. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>whoſe Authority is owned to be Supream by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City of</hi> Rome.</q>
                     <p n="1">1. That it muſt be a <hi>ſetled Sovereign Power,</hi> is confirmed from all the Examples of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where there are no Heads, or Horns to ſignify the Ruling Power of a Monarchy in the time of the <hi>unſetled</hi> Confuſions of a Nation; As particularly the time of the <hi>Magi,</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, has nothing to diſtinguiſh it from the reſt of it, nor the time of the Confuſed Scuffles of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Captains after his death. As may be ſeen in the 8th Chapter. Where there is no mention of any change of Horns after the <hi>firſt</hi> great one, till the riſing of thoſe four, which did ſignify the four <hi>ſetled</hi> Kingdoms of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire. And <hi>next,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That an Head of a Beaſt muſt be that <hi>Roman</hi> Power, <hi>whoſe Authority is owned to be Supream by the Chief Government of the City of</hi> Rome, one would think were ſufficiently evident by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation that the Angel himſelf has given of the ſignification of the ſeven Heads. For the ſame ſeven Heads, which he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets <note place="margin">1.</note> to be ſeven Kings of the <hi>Romans,</hi> do alſo ſignify the ſeven Hills of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is inſeparably tied; which does very plainly ſignify, that all the ſeven Kings are Kings of the <hi>ſeven Hills,</hi> or of that City, which thoſe Hills do ſignify.</p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:204884:107"/>
                     <p> What could be more cloſely joined together in a Prophetical Scheme, to ſhew them to be inſeparable Companions, than to make both Kings and City to be repreſented by the very ſame Figure? And therefore does it ſeem to be ſo very extravagant <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ribera,</hi> &amp;c.</note> an Opinion of ſome, to make the firſt five of theſe Heads to be perfect Strangers to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their Affairs. Neither <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> nor <hi>Grotius himſelf,</hi> could have the confidence to aſſert this, though it would have ſerved their purpoſe better than any of thoſe other ſtrange Suppoſitions, that they have advanced to anſwer their Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The whole time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy is ſet out by the Beaſt, and the ſeven Heads, by <hi>Prop.</hi> 15, and 16. And then the ſeven Heads being interpreted to ſignify the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> do plainly determine the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Royal Seat of that Monarchy during the <hi>whole time</hi> of it. The Reign therefore of every Head muſt neceſſarily go along with the Authority of that City.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. No other Empire whatſoever in all the Figures of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is ſo ſet out by its chief City, as this of the <hi>Romans</hi> is. So that the addition of the ſeven Hills to this Beaſt, does more inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably tye the Sovereign Authority of the Empire to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar City, and ſeems to be added on purpoſe to expreſs ſomething about <hi>this</hi> Empire, which had been omitted in all <hi>others,</hi> viz. The conſtant conjunction of the Sovereign Power of this Empire with the Authority of this City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. And it was neceſſary to do this, more than in the Figure of any other Monarchy, becauſe there are two kinds of Sovereign Powers in this Monarchy at one and the ſame time, that is, <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Horns;</hi> To diſtinguiſh which, at leaſt in the time of the <hi>laſt Head,</hi> there is no other mark in the Text, but <hi>only</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Head.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Authority of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> can be no more ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Sovereign Power of that Empire, than the Beaſt can be ſeparated from all its ſeven Heads.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The flouriſhing and decaying condition alſo of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, is ſet out by the flouriſhing and decaying condition of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> all over the Book of the <hi>Revelations.</hi> In the time of the ſixth Head, the whole Monarchy is deſcribed by the <note place="margin">Chap. 17. 4, 18.</note> Reign of the City of <hi>Rome over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> In the time of the laſt Ruling Head, <hi>Rome</hi> is deſcribed in a Majeſtick
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:204884:107"/> Appearance to expreſs the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Rule <hi>over Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues:</hi> And the ruinous and deſolate State of the <hi>City of Rome</hi> is afterwards made uſe of to <note place="margin">Chap. 16. 19. Chap. 18.</note> ſignify the fall of that Empire, and the laſt end of all <hi>Roman</hi> Rule; All which is ſufficient evidence, That the <hi>City of</hi> Rome goes conſtantly along with the chief Head of that State.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Fates of the chief City of any other Empire, that is mentioned by the Prophets, do generally ſignify the condition of the chief Head, or of the Sovereign Power that goes along with that City; And the end of any ſuch Ruling Power, or Empire, is expreſſed to be at the loſs of their Royal City. Thus is the flouriſhing and ruinous State of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſet out by the like Characters of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that of <hi>Judah</hi> by <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the riſe and fall of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> by the glory or ruine of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore by <hi>Rule the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> The Authority of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt go along with every Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, unleſs there were any thing clear againſt it, which is not pretended.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But moſt eſpecially muſt this be true of an Head of the Beaſt, at the time that <hi>Rome</hi> enjoyed the Enſigns and Badges of the chief Authority of the Empire; For that chief Authority is the <hi>diſtinguiſhing mark</hi> of an Head of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is impoſſible, that in the diviſion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, either into Two Empires, or into Ten Kingdoms, that the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould be an Head of the Beaſt, or of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, any longer than he was owned, and allowed either together <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>without</hi> another Partner, by the Senate and People of <hi>Rome, whilſt they did retain their uſual Authority.</hi> For as long as they continued in that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, let their State be never ſo much diminiſhed in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with what they had been, yet they had all the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Prophecy requires to be repreſented by an Head of the Beaſt. They were ſtill the <hi>Ruling People</hi> of the 7 Hills, and the ſame continued Body with thoſe that reigned in the moſt flouriſhing State of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>

For whatever the People of <hi>Rome</hi> could have formerly done of right before the time of the Emperours, the ſame had they power to do upon the death of any Emperour, before there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſen. The Election of the Emperours did alſo belong to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was oftentimes performed by the People, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>alone,</hi> or by the <hi>Senate</hi> for them; And thoſe Elections, which were made by firſt one, and then another Legion of the Army, were <hi>not valid</hi> by the right of thoſe Legions (for in a flitting Body there could be no certain right) but from the <hi>approbation of the People.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is no Objection againſt this, that by the Decree of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> all the Subjects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were made Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Subjects got nothing more by that Decree, than what the Colonies, and free Cities of the Empire, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces uſed to have, which was to be partakers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Honours, and to have the privileges of <hi>Quirites;</hi> not that the Seat and Fountain of Government ſhould be in other parts of the Empire, as it was at <hi>Rome.</hi> For that was not in the power of the Emperour to give, who could not change the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws for the exerciſe of the Governing Power.</p>
                           <p>Nor was it any diminution of the Right of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Emperours choſe rather to live at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> afterwards, than at <hi>Rome.</hi> For then alſo did the whole People of <hi>Rome</hi> confirm and make va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid the Election, which was made by a part of them at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who for that are called the <hi>Byzantine Quirites,</hi> by <hi>Claudian;</hi> And thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſtill preſerve the Prerogative of their City, and the honour of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence of their Conſul, which was no ſmall Monument of their Original Right.

                           <hi>An Account of the ſeveral changes of the form of the Government of</hi> Rome, <hi>from the time of the Viſion. The two Emperours were joynt-partners in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Empire, like the two Conſuls. The</hi> 22<hi>d Propoſition, the ſixth Head was</hi> at lateſt <hi>at an end upon the Fall of the Weſtern Empire in</hi> Auguſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. <hi>The Barbarous Kings of</hi> Italy, <hi>The Abſolute Maſters of</hi> Rome. <hi>Objections Anſwered.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Imperial Power continued the ſame from the time of the mention of it in this Prophecy under the name of <hi>the King,</hi> that was then in Rule, till about the year 160 after Chriſt, When <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> made <hi>Aelius Verus</hi> a ſharer with him in the Imperial Power under the name of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whereas there had never been before ſeen two Emperors with the names of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> at the ſame time. And this was taken notice of for ſo new a face of the Government, that ſome dated their <hi>Faſti</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Spartian <hi>in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</hi> Eutrop. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Conſulares</hi> from thence, as a new Epocha <hi>of time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This way of taking others into the Society of the Empire with them, was followed by other Emperors afterwards; as <hi>Severus</hi> with his Son <hi>Caracalla; Caracalla</hi> and his Brother <hi>Geta,</hi> the <hi>Gordiani:</hi> And in their time was there another Government ſet up, at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, called, the <hi>Twenty Men,</hi> who were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the Senate to Adminiſter the Affairs of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; and Ambaſſadors were ſent to all the Provinces of the Empire to contain them under the obedience of the Senate. But this continued but a ſhort time, and gave way to the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Balbinus</hi> and <hi>Papienus</hi> to the Imperial dignity, by the choice of thoſe Twenty Men themſelves; and with the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſome ſingle Emperors after them, The ſame Social Form of Empire returned again in <hi>Valerian,</hi> with his Son <hi>Gallien.</hi> And there were afterwards ſometimes three, and ſometimes four <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s together; which ſeems to be much like the change of a <hi>Dictator</hi> into <hi>two Conſuls:</hi> And the <hi>Dictators</hi> and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:204884:111"/> 
                        <hi>Conſuls</hi> are accounted two of the five Heads, or forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which were ſaid to be paſt at the time of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Another change was there in the Imperial Government, When the Emperors became <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and when the Laws of the Empire were made to conform to the Chriſtian Religion. This ſeems to ſome to be a change of the Government much more remarkable than any Political change, and to deſerve to be one of the two forms of Government that we are in queſt of; And beſides, it ſeems to be plainly deſcribed in the 12th Chap. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> as a very conſiderable change of the Government of the Empire under the ſhow of the Fall of the Dragon, upon which the Beaſt aſcends into the Throne preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after in the 13th Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The change of Religion again by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, does thereupon ſeem to put in for a title to another form; And thô the time of his Reign was very ſhort, yet it was as long as that of the <hi>Decemvirs,</hi> who are determined by moſt of the approved Interpreters, to be one of the Five Heads that were paſt at the time of the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, That his Reign was juſt almoſt the very ſame length of time, that the Beaſt is ſaid to Reign, That is, <hi>Three years and an half.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The diviſion of the Empire into the <hi>Weſtern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> ſeats, eſpecially when it came to be <hi>ſetled</hi> by <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> ſeems to have a very fair claim to the title of a new Head, or Change of the Imperial Government; And like to the ſucceſſion of the Conſuls to the Kingly Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are made two of the five forms of <hi>Roman</hi> Government, that were paſt at the time of the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſaid that theſe Emperors were rather two Heads, than <hi>one,</hi> like the repreſentation of <hi>two</hi> of the four Kingdoms in the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy, by two diſtinct Horns ſucceeding to <note place="margin">Dan. 8.</note> the firſt; It may be anſwered, That according to the account of all Hiſtorians, Thô they ſeemed to have a divided Empire, yet they acted in almoſt all the publick affairs, as but <note n="a" place="margin">BEllarmin <hi>de Tranſlat. Imperii Occident. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.<hi>—Erat tamen, &amp;c.</hi> But ſo common to them both was the whole Adminiſtration of the Empire (that is, <hi>to both the Weſtern and Eaſtern Emperour)</hi> that the Laws were made for the whole Empire, by the Authority, and in the name of <hi>both the Emperours.</hi> And if <hi>one</hi> of them died without Children, the Government of the whole Empire fell to the <hi>other.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>One</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>whole</hi> Empire; They had both their Authority confirmed at <hi>Rome,</hi> they owned the ſame Laws, and joyned together in the making of them; The Laws bear the names of both the Emperors; And no Laws could be made but by the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:204884:111"/> conſent of both the Princes: And if either of them died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Children, the other ſucceeded him in that part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                     <p>The ſupream Authority of <hi>Rome</hi> was divided betwixt them; part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate did always ſit at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> one of the Conſuls did ordinarily belong to that City. There was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a promiſcuous uſe of this right of chuſing the Conſuls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Two Imperial Seats, as <hi>Onuphrius Panurinus</hi> does ſhow, Lib. <hi>Faſtor,</hi> pag. 290. <hi>ſometimes</hi> both the Conſuls were made at <hi>Rome, ſometimes</hi> both at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſometimes none at all; <hi>ſometimes</hi> one in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> another in the <hi>Weſt:</hi> So that as <note n="b" place="margin">Panciroll. <hi>notit.

                        <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cirollus</hi> does very properly expreſs it, <hi>They ſeemed to be Two half Empires joyned together.</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:204884:112"/> from the beſt approved Hiſtorians of thoſe times; And the time of the Reign of theſe Barbarous Kings over <hi>Rome,</hi> was near 70 years.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Lombards,</hi> and the <hi>Franks,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> together, ſeem to make another Change of the Sovereign Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the ruine of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors intereſts in <hi>Italy;</hi> But thô the <hi>Lombards</hi> ſeemed to be the next Maſters of that Juriſdiction, yet they never could ſucceed in their attempts to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Rome:</hi> For they were checked in it, by the Power of the <hi>Franks,</hi> under <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlemain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then upon a Confederacy betwixt the Pope and thoſe Kings of the <hi>Franks, Rome</hi> was left wholly free to it ſelf, and <hi>Charlemaine</hi> was made Emperor of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and from him the Title continued to this day in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Line, with ſome ſmall intervals of vacancies.</p>
                     <p>Who would make any queſtion, whether here be not variety of Changes enough to make one conclude, That the Imperial Government, which was the Ruling Head in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time; muſt have been long ſince at <hi>an end?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One would indeed be more apt to judge from hence, That there hath been not <hi>only</hi> a Change of the <hi>Sixth</hi> Head ſince that time; but alſo four or five Heads beſides in ſucceſſion to one another. But ſince we are already aſſured, That the next Change but one to the Imperial Sixth Head, was to be the Beaſt, <hi>(Prop.</hi> 20.)

It is manifeſt, that there can be but Two of theſe ſeveral Changes of Government, that can be Heads of the Beaſt; the latter of which muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>In ſhort, one need but conſider who was the Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire before the fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether that Head were changed or no by that fall. It is certain, that if it were but one of the Imperial Thrones that was then the Head of it, it muſt be the Weſtern who had the chief Imperial Seat in his power, and then the Kings that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, muſt be a new Head; but if they were <hi>both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Head, as is moſt likely, then at the fall of the Weſtern Power, and the ſucceſſion of a new Regal Government in the ſtead of it; the whole Government of the State muſt be acknowledged to have been changed, and a <hi>new</hi> Head ſet up in the room of it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore inſtead of the whole Imperial Government in the Eaſtern and Weſtern parts of the Empire, by this new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> There is a Succeſſion of <hi>Kingly</hi> Government in the Weſtern part, to ſhare with the <hi>Imperial</hi> in the Eaſt: And of the Two, the Authority of the <hi>Kings</hi> muſt be acknowledged to be the <hi>moſt conſiderable part</hi> of the Head of <hi>Rome.</hi> But that the Imperial Government of <hi>Rome</hi> was then changed into <hi>another</hi> Form than what appeared before that conqueſt, is no ways to be queſtioned.</p>
                     <p>There muſt therefore neceſſarily be thereupon the appearance of a <hi>New Head;</hi> But whether it were the mixed form of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial and Kingly Government <hi>together,</hi> that made that Head, or the Kingly Government <hi>alone,</hi> need not yet be determined.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be here Objected, That the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings could not be any part of a <hi>Roman</hi> Head upon the account of their being quite another Nation diſtinct from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and therefore not poſſible to be any part of the ſame Beaſt by which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire is repreſented; and that there was then no other Head of the <hi>Romans</hi> at their Conqueſt, but the Imperial Head at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which continued the ſame for all the time of the Reign of thoſe Barbarous Kings of <hi>Italy;</hi> and ſo was never put an end to by them.</p>

                     <p>The continuance of the Imperial <hi>Roman</hi> Government at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> could not hinder the change of that Head, when there was a new face of Government at <hi>Rome:</hi> For beſides that it has been demonſtrated, that the eſſential Character of an Head of the Beaſt, is the Government owned at <hi>Rome</hi> (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 21.)

                     <p>SInce it has been made unqueſtionable from the preceding Propoſition, That the Sixth King, or Head, has been paſt for ſome hundreds of years. From thence it may as aſſuredly be concluded, That</p>

                        <hi>The Beaſt called the Eighth King, is a Sovereign</hi> Roman <note place="margin">Propoſit. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Power that is owned for Supream by the Authority of the City of</hi> Rome <hi>at this preſent.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the Sixth King in being at the time of the Viſion, was certainly at an <hi>end</hi> after the ruine of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire by the <hi>Heruli</hi> and <hi>Goths (Prop.</hi> 22.)—And the Seventh King does immediately ſucceed the Sixth (by <hi>Prop. the 18th)—</hi>And the Seventh King was to continue but a ſhort ſpace <hi>(chap.</hi> 17. 10.) Whereas the number of years from the Ruine of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to <hi>this preſent,</hi> is <hi>three times</hi> longer than the <hi>whole</hi> time of the ſixth Head from the date of the Viſion, and as long as the whole time of the other ſix Heads before.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the <hi>Seventh King</hi> muſt needs have been long ſince paſt, and the <hi>Eighth King</hi> (called the Beaſt) have entred upon his Reign. For the Eighth King did immediately ſucceed the Seventh (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 18.)—And the Eighth King, or the Beaſt, is to continue till the Second coming of Chriſt (by <hi>Corollar.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 12.)—And therefore muſt the time of the Beaſt be both begun already, and not yet paſt; that is, muſt be <hi>at preſent</hi> in being.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſame grounds it appears, That.</p>

                        <hi>The forty two Months of the Reign of the Beaſt,</hi> Revel. 13. 5. <hi>are at leaſt</hi> 1260 <hi>Years.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prop. 24.</note>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the Beaſt is in being <hi>at this preſent</hi> (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 23.)—And he began his Reign ſoon after the fall of the ſixth Head, becauſe the Seventh King was to continue but a ſhort ſpace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10.—And the ſixth Head was at lateſt ended at the fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire in <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 22.)—which was above 1200 Years ſince. It is therefore impoſſible, that the forty two Months of the Reign of the Beaſt ſhould have a <hi>literal</hi> ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this place. They muſt then of neceſſity be underſtood in a <hi>Myſtical</hi> Signification (by <hi>Rule</hi> 2.)—and in ſuch a <hi>Myſtical</hi> Signification alſo, as muſt make them contain in them above 1200 Years.</p>
                     <p>Now there is no Example in Prophecy of any ſuch Myſtical Signification of Time, as will make theſe forty two Months reach to 1200 Years, and make them leſs exceed that number of Years, than the Myſtical uſe of Weeks and Days in ſome of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Weeks are by almoſt the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimous Conſent</hi> of all Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taken for ſo many Years as they have days in them, in that famous Prophecy about the firſt coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> into the World, in the 9th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> v. 24. under the name of the <hi>ſeventy Weeks.</hi> This is an unexceptionable Inſtance of the myſtical uſe of <hi>days</hi> for <hi>years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So alſo is the Year of Jubilee after 49 years called the end of ſeven Sabbaths, or weeks of years, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Days</hi> alſo are made uſe of to ſignify <hi>Years</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> twice in one Chapter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 4, 6. and in the ſame manner in the Book of <hi>Numbers</hi> 14. 34.</p>
                     <p>Againſt theſe two laſt Examples it is pretended, That Days do not <hi>abſolutely</hi> ſignify Years, but are only made <hi>the Types</hi> of Years. But this is no material Objection againſt this uſage of Days. For though in thoſe two places they be uſed but as Types, yet it is eaſie to obſerve, that Types of things are ordinarily uſed in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> for the things themſelves after the Type is fulfilled in them; and in that uſe of them they ſignify the things <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and <hi>not Typically;</hi> for a typical ſignification of any thing, is the ſignification of it before it is come to paſs, which cannot be, when the Type is uſed for the real thing it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:204884:118"/> ſelf <hi>then in being.</hi> And therefore in ſuch a uſe of the typical word, it muſt ſignify the thing <hi>abſolutely only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus do we find the names of <hi>Temple, Altar,</hi> the <hi>Holieſt of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> the <hi>Vail,</hi> the <hi>Paſſeover-Lamb,</hi> uſed to ſignify, the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> the <hi>Communion, Heaven,</hi> this <hi>Earthly ſtate, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> after theſe Types were accompliſhed, and ſo after their <hi>typical</hi> time was paſt.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame reaſon may any other Type be uſed to ſignify a thing <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as well as <hi>typically.</hi> And <hi>Days</hi> may for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be as well ſuppoſed to ſignify <hi>Years abſolutely</hi> in ſome places, becauſe uſed to ſignify them <hi>typically</hi> in others, if there be any evidence againſt their <hi>literal</hi> acceptation, as there is here found to be.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore according to theſe Examples, eſpecially that of <hi>the</hi> 70 <hi>weeks,</hi> which is by all acknowledged, the 42 Months muſt be conſidered, as containing ſo many years in them as they have days in them; and the leaſt number of days that they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them, is 1260. whatſoever accounts of Months be taken either in the time of <hi>Daniel,</hi> or of St. <hi>John.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be hereupon enquired, <hi>What kind of Months</hi> theſe were, and <hi>how many days</hi> they did preciſely contain in them, the relation that this account of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> has to the fourth Beaſt in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> will reſolve that difficulty. The 42 Months of the Beaſt in this place, are the Times of the <hi>Little Horn</hi> in that 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> (by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll.</hi> 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> 15.) And the Times of the Little Horn there, are ſaid to be a <hi>time, times, and half a time;</hi> which therefore muſt be the ſame with the 42 Months of the Beaſt, they being both of them the ſame time of the ſame Reign. Now the Time, <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> Times, and an half, are in the 12th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations</hi> the ſame time of the Woman's abode in the Wilderneſs, which is <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> a little before ſaid to be 1260 days. The 42 Months then, which is the ſame time of the Reign of the Beaſt with the Time, Times, and an half, muſt alſo be but 1260 days.</p>
                     <p>By this then it appears, That the calculation of theſe Months muſt be according to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Account, where <hi>Daniel</hi> lived, when he wrote that Prophecy, to which this of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> does every-where refer. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> had but 30 days in their Months, and they were all of equal length; to which they added an Appendix of five days at the end of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:204884:119"/> Year, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called the <hi>Epagomena,</hi> and ſo made their Year to be 365 days. But without the <hi>Epagomena,</hi> three Years and an half make but 1260 days, which is the number that theſe Viſions about the Beaſt do ſo often inculcate, and is 17 days ſhort of the true Account of three years and an half in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> way.</p>
                     <p>And this is the only reaſon that I could ever find ſatisfactory, Why, beſides the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>an half,</hi> there, is the mention of 42 <hi>Months,</hi> and 1260 <hi>days</hi> in the Prophecy, to expreſs the ſame number of years. For the <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>an half,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing elſe to reſtrain it, would have been underſtood to be <hi>three full years,</hi> and an half, according to the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, from whence that calculation was fetched, and ſo would really have been 17 days longer, and have ſignified 17 years longer than they really were to be; whereas by this particular determination of them in the Prophecy to 1260 days, and 42 Months, they appear to want the Appendix of the five days, or <hi>Epagomena,</hi> at the end of every Year. And thus are we deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that fanciful Shift, that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> was fain to fly to in his account of the different ways of expreſſing the ſame time here, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Months were uſed to ſignify the <hi>works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and the <hi>days</hi> the contrary: The Months being regulated by the courſe of the Moon, and the days by that of the Sun.</p>
                     <p>The 42 Months then do appear by this to be 15 days ſhort of the full length of <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>half a time,</hi> by being reckoned without the <hi>Epagomena;</hi> It may hereupon be very reaſonably imagined, that the 1260 Years ſignified by ſo many days, may each of them alſo be reckoned without the <hi>Epagomena,</hi> or five days at the end of them; and then <hi>they</hi> will <hi>alſo</hi> want ſome ſuch number of Years of their <hi>full</hi> account, and ſo prove to be but 1243 Years.</p>
                     <p>From the former Propoſition it may be concluded, That</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:204884:119"/> ſince they have the ſame length of time aſſigned to them for their continuance, it ought to be underſtood to ſignify the ſame thing without any clearer Evidence to the contrary (by <hi>Rule the</hi> 3<hi>d.)—</hi>Now by their Characters they appear to be capable of ſo long a continuance. For they repreſent a body of Men, and not two ſingle Perſons only.

                     <p> By this it appears, That they muſt refer to ſome twofold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the whole Catholick Church that muſt be generally known for 1260 years together; And in this reſpect the Reaſon why they are repreſented by <hi>Two,</hi> may be either,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The natural diviſion of every well conſtituted People into <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Perſons, the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> eſpecially where the Church of God is, which is the preſent Caſe. As this does go along with all well-ordered Societies, ſo it is exemplified in two of the Inſtances here referred to out of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, 2. The Church may here be repreſented by <hi>Two,</hi> upon the account of the known peculiar Character of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>in diſtinction to that of the Jews,</hi> all over the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> where it is every-where repreſented, as <hi>one</hi> Church made up of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, one</hi> Common Society with thoſe <hi>two</hi> great conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Parts in it; upon the account of which it was <hi>originally</hi> called the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus do we find † St. <hi>Paul</hi> almoſt continually inſiſting upon this <hi>Two-fold</hi> diſtinction in the Church; and the chief ground of <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 30. &amp; 4. 16. &amp; 9. 24. &amp; 10. 12. &amp; 11. 17. &amp; 15. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 1. 24. &amp; 7. 18, 19. Gal. 27. 8. &amp; 4. 22, 24. &amp; 6. 15, 16. Epheſ. 3. 6, 9.</note> all his earneſt Motives to Unity, and Mutual Communion, for the making the Chriſtian Church <hi>but one</hi> thing, is, that all the World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are but one Church of Chriſt. As <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. and Chap. 3. 6. and Chap. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And this is every-where repreſented by him, as the great Myſtery of God, in the bringing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to be one Church with the <hi>Jews,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 9. 3. 3, 9. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 26, 27. This Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> does alſo generally run upon that diſtinction. As Chap. 5. 5. The number of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Elders gathered <hi>out of all Nations.</hi> And Chap. 7. 4, 9. <hi>The</hi> 144000 <hi>out of the Jewiſh Tribes,</hi> but figuratively taken; and the <hi>Great Multitude</hi> of all Nations. So alſo Chap. 14. 1, 6. The 144000, and all Nations, and Kindreds, and Tongues, and People. And Chap. 19. 4, 6. The 24 Elders repreſent the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> part, and the Voice of the Great Multitude the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though both figuratively. And the Church is every-where ſet forth as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple, or Synagogue, ſet open to <hi>all people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This alſo we find every-where foretold in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> as the <hi>peculiar diſtinction</hi> of the Church of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> from that of the <hi>Jews, That</hi> it ſhould be the Church of both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> And this does our Saviour alſo make the diſtinguiſhing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:204884:120"/> Badge of his Church. <hi>For this reaſon</hi> did he make choice of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be the Initial Rite of all Nations into his Church, which by the <hi>Jews</hi> had always before been made the <hi>diſtinguiſhing Rite</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 11. &amp; 21. 43. &amp; 22. 9. &amp; 24. 14. John 11. 52.</note> betwixt themſelves, and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Proſelites. He alſo upon the ſame account ordered the Memorial of his own Death to be the Communion-Feaſt, or the common Union of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> in his Church, or the Communion of Saints of all kinds, inſtead of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> which was the diſtinguiſhing Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> from all the reſt of the World beſides. And thus alſo does he himſelf ſignify his Church to be <hi>One Fold made up of two ſorts of Sheep,</hi> John 10. 16.</p>
                     <p>But this does moſt eminently appear in the Hiſtory of the Actions of the Apoſtles, after Jeſus had committed the ſole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Church to them. The chief Subject of the Book of their <hi>Acts</hi> is to ſet forth this <hi>new appearance</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church with theſe <hi>Two</hi> different kinds of Members in it.</p>
                     <p>Indeed this <hi>twofold</hi> diſtinction of the Members of the Chriſtian Church had its foundation in the known diviſion of the whole World into thoſe two general Parts of it, <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> both always before, and at the time of the writing this Prophecy. And this diſtinction was always preſerved in memory by the frame of the <hi>Jewiſh Temple,</hi> and its diſtinction of the <hi>two Courts</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and ſo ſeems to be the moſt likely to be here referred to, becauſe the moſt obvious, and commonly known diviſion of the Church of God into <hi>Two.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what ſtrength ſoever this Account of their being called <hi>Two,</hi> may ſeem to have, yet the demonſtration of their real na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general before given, does not at all depend upon it. This is intended only for a probable illuſtration of that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. And ſince by the diſcovery of their Nature, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the whole Chriſtian Church for many Ages, there muſt be ſome reference in this Character of it to ſome twofold divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Chriſtian Church, which muſt diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> and none was better known for ſuch, than that which has been here pitched upon; not that of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> nor that of the Churches of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> which ſome would have that number to refer to. <note place="margin">

                        </note> two <hi>diſtinct</hi> things <hi>really</hi> different from one another.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true; All the miſchief, for which the Firſt Beaſt is ſo ſtigmatized in this Prophecy, is that which is the <hi>whole buſineſs</hi> of the Second Beaſt; that is, <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip, tyrannically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Image,</hi> which the Second Beaſt ſets up; This the firſt Beaſt aſſiſts, and enforces by his Power; And <hi>upon this account</hi> are theſe Two Beaſts repreſented as <hi>one Confederacy.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one is often comprehended in what is ſaid to be done by the other, becauſe it is one common Intereſt that they <hi>both</hi> act in; and in which they <hi>both</hi> act at the ſame time. So that to ſignify the Activity of either of them, it is enough on many occaſions to intimate the name of but one of them; as we ſee the name of <hi>either</hi> of the two Partners in a Trade does ſignify the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>other</hi> in it, who was not named.</p>
                     <p>But that they are notwithſtanding <hi>both</hi> of them Supream Heads in their ſeveral ways, with an abſolute Juriſdiction belonging to them, appears from that Power of the Second Beaſt, by which he <hi>gave life to the Image</hi> of the Firſt Beaſt, and impowered it <hi>to kill all</hi> who would not worſhip it: For it is certain from that, <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> That the Second Beaſt himſelf muſt have that Power of Life and Death to himſelf, which he gave to the Image, and therefore be Supream.</p>
                     <p>From hence it would be inferred, That</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>The Second Beaſt is a</hi> Pontifex Maximus <hi>of the</hi> Romans <hi>after the time of the Heathen Emperors.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>For (by <hi>Propoſ. preced.)</hi> the Second Beaſt muſt be a Supream Church-Head of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is a <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi> And

So that there is none elſe that has the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being the one Secular Head of <hi>Rome</hi> in the midſt of Ten Horns, or the diviſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire into Ten Kings.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be further urged, That thoſe dreadful Acts of <hi>Antichriſtian Tyranny</hi> over the whole World, which are attributed to the Beaſt, do very little ſuit with the Power of the Imperial Government at preſent.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be conſidered, That there is a plain deſcription of two different States of the Power of the Beaſt in the Prophecy it ſelf: The <hi>firſt</hi> before the Riſe of the Second Beaſt, or Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and there he is deſcribed as acting upon his own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and it is ſaid that <hi>all the World did worſhip him,</hi> and that he had power over <hi>all Tongues and Nations,</hi> &amp;c. And that <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 8.</note> does very well anſwer any time of the <hi>Imperial</hi> enforcement of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion by their <hi>Laws,</hi> and their Execution of the <hi>Acts of Councils,</hi> before the Popes had got the whole Superiority
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:204884:124"/> into their Hands. For then the Imperial Power was the only <hi>Roman</hi> Power that was worſhipped, or whoſe Will and Law about Religion was ſet up for the <hi>Laws of God</hi> to the World.</p>
                     <p>But then there is <hi>another</hi> State of the Power of the Beaſt after the Riſe of the Second Beaſt, or Falſe Prophet, where all his <note place="margin">v. 12.</note> Power is exerciſed before his face by <hi>another;</hi> and in that ſtate the charge of <hi>Anti-chriſtian Tyranny</hi> over the whole World does belong to the Beaſt, as he is <hi>confederated</hi> with thoſe who act all theſe things; and it is attributed to the Beaſt <hi>only,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his continuing ſtill the <hi>Secular Head</hi> of that Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; As any Cruelty done by the Officers of any Army againſt the Enemy, is ſaid to be <hi>all</hi> done by the General.</p>
                     <p>But to ſhew us, that all this miſchief was chiefly chargeable upon his Confederates, and Inſtruments only; We ſee all that Tragical part acted by the <hi>Image</hi> of the Beaſt which was inſpired by the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> who is deſcribed as the principal Actor in all the Bloodſhed and Murther of thoſe, who would not <hi>worſhip the Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>his Image;</hi> And that <hi>this Image</hi> is a thing quite <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 15, 16, 17.</note> from the Beaſt, will be made afterwards to appear; as alſo how both the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and his <hi>Image,</hi> are the Objects of the falſe Worſhip enjoined.</p>
                     <p>But yet after all, It cannot but be acknowledged, that it is every way more certain, and unqueſtionable, that the preſent <hi>Papal</hi> Power muſt be the Falſe Prophet, how dubious ſoever his real diſtinction from that, which is called the Beaſt, may ſeem to be. For the Character of the Falſe Prophet cannot poſſibly fit <hi>any other</hi> Church-Head of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time in being, <hi>but</hi>

                        <hi>only</hi> that Power. And the <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> muſt neceſſarily be now in being, becauſe the Beaſt (his individual Companion, whoever he is, to the laſt end of them both) is certainly now in being. <note place="margin">Rev. 19.</note>

                           <hi>The firſt Query, Whether at</hi> Juſtinian<hi>'s Recovery of</hi> Italy <hi>from the</hi> Goths, <hi>there had not been Two Changes of</hi> Roman <hi>Government ſince the time of the Viſion?</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THus far there ſeems to be a general agreement amongſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all kind of conſiderable Interpreters, who make The Beaſt to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Power in being at this preſent time; and this ſeems ſufficient for the main uſe that is to be made of this kind of knowledg.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe Mens minds are uſually very uneaſy under ſuch a general aſſurance of the main foundation, without a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular determination of the firſt riſe, of the time of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,</hi> and the <hi>laſt period</hi> of ſo formidable a power as that of the Beaſt, and the Falſe Prophet is deſcribed to be; I will now proceed to propound my apprehenſions about thoſe particular circumſtances; which is ſo much the more neceſſary, becauſe almoſt all the applications of the many Characters and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Beaſt, do ſeem to depend upon ſuch a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe I know it will be difficult to prevail with any who have framed to themſelves an Hypotheſis of their own about theſe things, to ſee any convincing proof for the way that I make choice of; To be civil to the Underſtandings and Aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>others,</hi> I will now propound my own particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the name of Queries, inſtead of Propoſitions, thô to my ſelf they may appear to be of much the ſame ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>I would therefore <hi>firſt</hi> have it conſidered,</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Whether at the time of</hi> Juſtinian<hi>'s Conqueſt of the</hi> Italian <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>1</label> Goths, <hi>there had not been,</hi> at leaſt, <hi>Two ſuch Changes of the</hi> Secular <hi>Soveraign Power of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſince the time of the Viſions about the Beaſt, as might be called Two different Heads of the Beaſt?</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>For the <hi>Secular</hi> Soveraign Power of <hi>Rome</hi> at the time of the Viſion, was the Imperial Government and Sixth Head (by

                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 19. and 5.)—And the Imperial Government as the Sixth Head was changed, <hi>at lateſt,</hi> upon the ruin of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by the <hi>Heruli</hi> and <hi>Goths</hi> (by <hi>Prop.</hi> the 22.)—There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then nothing more to be done for the determining of this queſtion, than to ſhow, That the Succeſſion of the <hi>Heruli,</hi> and <hi>Goths,</hi> to the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> did make a <hi>new</hi> Head of the Beaſt: For then it will not be queſtioned, but that, the Conqueſt of the <hi>Goths</hi> by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> did alſo make the other Head that <hi>was to be revived.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Succeſſion of thoſe Barbarous Kings at <hi>Rome</hi> did make a <hi>new</hi> Head of the Beaſt, appears from the definition of an Head of the Beaſt <hi>(Prop. the 21ſt.)</hi> For upon the ruin of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire by theſe Kings, and their Reign over <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> The Supream <hi>Secular</hi> Power of <hi>Rome</hi> was changed, and another owned there in the place of it. Thô the <hi>one</hi> part of the Imperial Head remained ſtill ſound at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> yet by the change of the <hi>other</hi> part of it, which did more immediately preſide over the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Soveraign power of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> came to be divided betwixt a <hi>King</hi> and an <hi>Emperor:</hi> And ſo, that which was a form of Government <hi>purely Imperial</hi> before, came to be a mixture of Kingly and Imperial Government.</p>
                     <p>For that the <hi>new Kings</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern Emperours,</hi> made ſtill but <hi>one</hi> Supream form of <hi>Roman</hi> Government, thô divided in the Seats of their Empire, appears from the ſtate of the Imperial Government before the ruin of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire by theſe Barbarous Kings.

                     <p>It is alſo a remarkable obſervation of <hi>Joh. Ferſius Sileſius</hi> to this purpoſe in his Book <hi>de Praefect.

                     <p>Again, <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Emperours and <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings had the name of <hi>Rerum Domini,</hi> or Lords of the World, from <hi>the ſame City of</hi> Rome, which was then called, <hi>The Head of all things.</hi> Of the Emperours, it is unqueſtionable; and <note n="x" place="margin">

                     <p>And accordingly we find the Dates of the Pontificates in thoſe times, to have the King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> as well as the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi>

                     <p>From hence then it may be certainly concluded, That ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a change of the Form of the Sovereign power of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſufficient to give it the name of one of thoſe two laſt Kings of the Eight, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10, 11. which ſhould come <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after</hi> that Imperial Sixth Head which Ruled at the time of the Viſion; for it has all the qualifications of one of thoſe Kings; That is, it is a change of the Supreme Government of <hi>Rome.</hi> And to know what kind of change of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſufficient for the Title of one of theſe Kings, one muſt conſult the Examples of thoſe, which were paſt <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is certain, That the five firſt changes (called the <hi>five</hi> Kings <hi>paſt,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> in being) could be nothing but the change of the name <hi>of the Civil Sovereign power,</hi> let them be what they will in particular: For there was <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the ſame Religion</hi> in them all. There are then <hi>five</hi> plain inſtances in the ſame Figure, to juſtify the making of this change of the name of the Civil <hi>Roman</hi> Government at the ruin of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to be one of thoſe Two Kings of the Eight, which were to come after the Imperial Sixth Head, that was the King at the time of the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, There is alſo the example of the Ten Horns, or Ten Kings (repreſented by them) to ſhow the difference betwixt the Supreme powers, which they ſignified, to be nothing but <hi>outward civil</hi> differences. For thoſe Ten Kings are ſaid to be of one and the ſame Religion, to be of <hi>one mind,</hi> and to agree together in falſe Worſhip. <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 13, 17.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here are then <hi>Sixteen</hi> inſtances in the ſame Figure, to ſhow that the change of the <hi>Civil Form</hi> of <hi>Roman</hi> Government by the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings was ſufficient to make them to be accounted one of thoſe Two Kings that were to come after the Sixth King, that Ruled in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time.</p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:204884:132"/>
                     <p> If further we conſult the uſages of the Figures in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that ſignify Kings, we ſhall find there, that the <hi>only note of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> to know different Kings by, is ſome outward civil dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, either upon the account of a different Dominion, or for being another name of the Civil Government in the ſame Dominion; and the number of the inſtances of that kind in that Prophecy are about Thirty.</p>
                     <p>So that there ſeems to be no manner of reaſon, why this change of the <hi>name</hi> of the Sovereign Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the <hi>Goths</hi> ſucceeding the Imperial, ſhould not be one of thoſe Two Kings, that were to come after the Imperial, ſince All the Eight Kings are agreed to be ſo many changes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>And thô it ſhould be ſaid, That the <hi>change of the Religion</hi> of the Empire by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was one of thoſe Kings; yet ſince the different kind of the Civil Government under the ſame Religion, have been found to be the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>all</hi> the Kings <hi>beſides,</hi> that are figuratively mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Revelations;</hi> This conſtant uſage of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical expreſſions, in above Sixty Inſtances, is ſurely war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough to make that remarkable change of the Civil Form of the Sovereign Power, at the fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to be <hi>another</hi> King, thô the Religion might continue the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Now if this change of the name of the Civil Government by the <hi>Goths,</hi> were either the Seventh or Eighth King after the Imperial, then it muſt make a <hi>new</hi> Head, becauſe it is one of the <hi>firſt and cleareſt Propoſitions</hi> that has been advanced, That every one of thoſe Eight Kings are one of the Seven Heads of the Beaſt, by <hi>Prop.</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Second Query, Whether the Reign of the Beaſt did not begin with</hi> Juſtinian<hi>'s Conqueſts of the</hi> Italian Goths? <hi>This endeavoured to be demonſtrated. Eighteen Objections anſwered.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AFTER what has been ſaid for the making the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings <hi>one</hi> of the Eight Kings, it will eaſily be granted, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> muſt make <hi>another</hi> new Head, becauſe it had the ſame qualifications that the <hi>other</hi> before it had for being one of the Two Kings after the Imperial, that ruled at the time of the Viſion; that is, It was a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable change of the <hi>name</hi> of the Civil Sovereign Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the only conſtant difference betwixt all the Changes in the ſame Empire, that are to be found in <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Revelations;</hi> And Examples are the Rules that are to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in Interpretations (by <hi>Rule</hi> 2, and 3.) Now if this be once granted, it ſeems to be ſcarce worth the making it a queſtion,</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Whether the firſt Riſe of the Beaſt were not upon the Conqueſt of the</hi> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>2</label> Goths <hi>in</hi> Italy <hi>by</hi> Juſtinian?</q>
                     <p>For the Beaſt is in being at this preſent (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 23.) And he could not ariſe either before or after <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Not after it.</hi> For at that time there had been at leaſt two Changes of the <hi>Secular</hi> Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the time of the Viſion (by <hi>Query</hi> 1.)—And the laſt of theſe two Changes is the Beaſt (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 20.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Beaſt could <hi>not</hi> ariſe <hi>before</hi> that time. For then at <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt there would have been another Change of the Civil Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo would the Beaſt have been put an end to; but the time of the Beaſt is not yet paſt (by <hi>Prop.</hi> 23. and <hi>Coroll.</hi> 4. <hi>Prop.</hi> 15.) Now if the firſt Riſe of the Beaſt could be neither before, nor after <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt, it muſt neceſſarily be at the ſame time with it.</p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:204884:135"/>
                     <p> The whole ſtrength of this proof does lie upon the general Notion of Heads, and Horns, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and the <hi>conſtant mark</hi> of their diſtinction from one another; And the <hi>mark</hi> of their diſtinction from one another in all the known Examples of Figures in both theſe Prophecies, is nothing, but either a diſtinct juriſdiction, or a different name of the Civil Government, and not any differences from one another in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>any other accidental qualifications.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The differences of the Heads, or Horns, that are deſcribed to be in Rule in the ſame Kingdom all at one time, are nothing but diſtinct civil Juriſdictions in that one Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>The differences betwixt Succeſſive Heads, or Horns, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Succeſſive Change of the ſtate of the Beaſt, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Obſerv. 4. Prop. 16.</note> but new names of the Civil Sovereign Power of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. If the change be from one to many, then it ſignifies the divided ſtate of that Monarchy, and the change of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Form of it into many diſtinct Principalities ruling in it; as may be ſeen in the Example of the Fourth Beaſt with the Ten Horns, in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in the He-Goat, of the 8th Chapter, with the <hi>firſt</hi> Horn, and the other <hi>four</hi> after him. If the Change be repreſented by ſingle Heads, or Horns, coming after one another, then every Head, or Horn, ſignifies a new name of the Ruling Power of that Monarchy, without any diviſions in it. So, as has been ſhown, does the Second Horn of the Ram of the 8th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſignify the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Sovereign Power over the ſame Nation of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> by the name of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> in the place of the King of <hi>Media.</hi> And the ſix firſt Heads of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that are deſcribed as ſucceeding in order, do all ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the ſeveral changes of the name of the chief Ruling Power of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe Examples it appears, That the only Conſtitutive or Eſſential difference of an Head of the Beaſt, is a new different name of the Civil Power that rules in chief; And therefore there ſeems to be no ground from the known Examples of the ſignification of Succeſſive Heads, or Horns, to make the riſe of the Chriſtian Religion, in the Imperial Head, by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to be a new King of the Seven, whenas the <hi>ſame civil Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> continued under the <hi>ſame name</hi> of the Imperial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Government of Emperors.</p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:204884:135"/>
                     <p> If the many inſtances of this kind in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which (counting the three ſhows of the Seven Heads, and Ten Horns in the <hi>Revelations)</hi> are more than ſeventy, be of any force, then the Imperial Government cannot be ſaid to be changed by the Succeſſion of a new King, till there be another different Form of Civil Government ſet up at <hi>Rome</hi> in its place, under <hi>another name;</hi> And then the Imperial Form, which is ſaid to be in being at the time of the Viſion, will continue the ſame, till the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Empire was cut off by the <hi>Heruli,</hi> and <hi>Goths</hi> of <hi>Italy;</hi> which will ſhew it to be neceſſary for the return of the Imperial Rule again over <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> to be the <hi>Eighth, which was one of the Seven,</hi> that is, <hi>the ſixth returned into being again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Riſe of the Beaſt with <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> may be thus further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
                     <p>The Beaſt is the Eighth King, <hi>and was of the Seven,</hi> Rev. 17. 11. and therefore was one of the Seven Kings, who had been in Rule before, and was returned into it again (by <hi>Coroll. Prop.</hi> 4.) But he could not have been the Seventh King, that was in Rule before, becauſe then he would have been the Seventh ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and not a new King with the name of an Eighth. <hi>See Coroll. Prop.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>The Beaſt therefore muſt have been either the Sixth King, that is, the Imperial Government returned into Rule again, or one of the other five <hi>before</hi> it. But before the time of <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> there was neither any reſtauration of the Imperial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was fallen from it <hi>before,</hi> nor any new revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any of the <hi>other five</hi> Governments of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were before the Imperial.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It will be objected, That this would make the Imperial Head <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Objections. </seg>
                        </label> to continue unchanged from the time of the Viſion, to the fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire; whereas the Sixth Head ſeems plainly to be repreſented to have its deadly wound upon the Dragon at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>'s <note place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> Converſion of the Imperial Head to Chriſtianity. For immediately after that, in the 13th Chapter, is the Beaſt ſhown with his <hi>Head wounded to death,</hi> and <hi>yet healed again,</hi> after the Dragon had been ſaid in the 12th Chapter to have been thrown down from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>All that can be made appear from the fall of the Dragon (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <label type="milestone">

                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:204884:136"/> 
                        <hi>Imperial Head againſt the Chriſtan Church,</hi> was then at an end, and that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was mounted on the Throne <hi>inſtead</hi> of it. But there is no manner of hint about the end of the Imperial <hi>Head it ſelf,</hi> or of the change of it for a new Head; It is <hi>only</hi> the change of the Reign of the Devil in that Head, and therefore is it ſaid to be <hi>Satan</hi> only caſt down: And though one would judge this to be a great change of Affairs, yet there was no reaſon from hence to make the loſs of the Dragon's Power the <hi>end of an Head,</hi> becauſe his Power never was <hi>the beginning of one;</hi> The Imperial Head had not its denomination or diſtinctive Character from the other Heads upon the account of the power of the Dragon in it, and therefore it cannot ceaſe to be an Head, <hi>only</hi> for having that power caſt out of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it was not the power of the Dragon that was the diſtinguiſhing Character</hi> of the Imperial Head from thoſe that were before it, is certain. For the Red Dragon with the Seven Heads and Ten Horns, muſt neceſſarily be ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Power perſecuting the Church of God: And then it muſt 1. Either begin at <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Conqueſt of <hi>Judaea,</hi> which was in the time of the Conſulary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and continued in the Dictatorſhip of <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> and ſo the Red Dagon would be in one or two Heads <hi>more</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Imperial, and therefore could not be <hi>the mark of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> betwixt them and the Imperial: If ſo, then the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Imperial Government <hi>without the Dragon in it,</hi> has all reaſon to be accounted the <hi>ſame Head</hi> ſtill, ſince the Dragon was no part of the eſſential difference of the Imperial Head from the two others that went before it; and therefore does the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of the Dragon out of the Imperial Head, make no change of that Property which made it an Head: Or, 2dly, The Dragon muſt be the <hi>Roman perſecution</hi> of the Chriſtians. And then the Imperial Head would have been begun <hi>a long time before</hi> the time of the Dragon in it; which would plainly ſhow, that as the Imperial Government was an Head of the Beaſt <hi>before it was poſſeſſed</hi> by the Dragon, ſo muſt it continue the ſame Head of the Beaſt <hi>after it was diſpoſſeſſed</hi> of the Dragon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And whereas this Opinion ſeems to be countenanced from the immediate conſequence of it in the 13th Chapter, which is <note place="margin">v. 3.</note> the appearance of an Head wounded to death, and healed again; It is to be conſidered, that the maintainers of this Opinion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do allow at leaſt 140 years ſpace, betwixt the Fall of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:204884:136"/> Dragon, and the Riſe of that other Beaſt: And then there is no Argument at all from the nearneſs of the two Viſions to one another, either to interpret that Fall of the wounding of any of the Seven Heads, or to make ſo little a diſtance of ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Fall, and the Riſe of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>There is a plain mention of <hi>a flood caſt out of the Dragon's</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>mouth,</hi> which in Prophetick Language ſignifying an <hi>inundation of vaſt multitudes of People,</hi> does give opportunity and time enough for the wounding of the Head, and the <hi>healing it again;</hi> and this diſtance betwixt them is by our Adverſaries ſaid to be 140 years.</p>
                     <p>Indeed this very 13th Chapter does ſhew the power of the Dragon to be <hi>wholly ſpiritual,</hi> conſidered by himſelf; For he is repreſented here as active as he was before he was caſt down; which ſhews that he was only <hi>an Evil Spirit in one of the Heads,</hi> and <hi>not the Head it ſelf.</hi> For then his caſting down would have been <hi>the Dragon's deadly wound,</hi> as the Head of the Beaſt, that was before paſt, is repreſented to be ſo wounded; whereas the Dragon is as much in action <hi>after</hi> his fall, as he was <hi>before.</hi> He was then the ſame ſpiritual Power when he was <hi>in the Head,</hi> and when he was <hi>caſt out of it;</hi> and therefore <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It will be further urged, that this would make the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Head continue an Head of the Beaſt after it was turned Chriſtian, whereas the Heads of the Beaſt are ſaid to have the <hi>names of blaſphemy</hi> upon them.</p>

                     <p>He does alſo there furniſh us with another Anſwer to this, that the names of blaſphemy are upon the Seven Heads in the 13th Chapter, to ſignify the Idolatrous State of the <hi>Seven Hills,</hi> or of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reign, when the Crowns were upon the <hi>Horns,</hi> or when the Empire was divided into ſo many Sovereigns; But the Crowns were upon the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> in the 12th Chapter to ſhew, that then there was no other Seat of <hi>Roman</hi> Reign, but the <hi>Seven Hills.</hi> In this way the <hi>names of blaſphemy</hi> have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>Seven Kings,</hi> that are ſignified by the Seven Heads, but <hi>only to the Seven Hills,</hi> which they do alſo repreſent, or the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of the Ten Kings.

                     <p>But that which is chiefly to be regarded for the qualifying him for this character of an Head amongſt the Ten Horns, is, That he is properly ſaid to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Head of thoſe Ten Kings in one common Deſign that they are all engaged in, becauſe he is ſo acknowledged to be by the Falſe Prophet, who manages them all for that end, and gives Him the Title of their <hi>Head</hi> in it.</p>

But it will be then demanded, How <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Imperial Head, can be the <hi>next</hi> Change <hi>but one</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sovereignty after the time of the Viſion? For the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Empire into Ten Sovereignties before him, would be accounted at leaſt one Change of the Sovereign Power of that Empire, as the <hi>four</hi> Horns of the <hi>He Goat,</hi> in the 8th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> was a <hi>new ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy. If ſo, then the fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire muſt unqueſtionably be another Change of the <hi>Roman</hi> Rule; and thus would there have been an 8th King from the Sixth, that ruled in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, <hi>before</hi> Juſtinian.</p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:204884:142"/>
                     <p> To reſolve this Scruple, it muſt be conſidered, That there are two <hi>different kinds of Sovereign Power</hi> repreſented in the Beaſt; the <hi>one</hi> by his <hi>Heads,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> by his <hi>Horns.</hi> And the <hi>next</hi> Change of Sovereignty <hi>but one</hi> to that, which ruled in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, which conſtitutes the 8th King, or the Beaſt, is a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an <hi>Head</hi> of the Beaſt, by <hi>Prop.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>And that <hi>Head</hi> is called <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> as a thing <hi>diſtinct from the Ten Horns;</hi> for the Ten Horns are ſaid to <hi>give their Kingdom to the Beaſt,</hi> who before had been ſaid to be the Eighth King, and is one of the Seven Heads, by <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. <hi>Coroll.</hi> It matters not therefore at what time the Ten Horns aroſe. For they were but ſo many Sovereignties in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire <hi>diſtinct</hi> from that Eighth King, which is the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or an <hi>Head</hi> of the Beaſt; and who were confederated with him: And to know the time of that <hi>Confederacy,</hi> it muſt be enquired <hi>firſt,</hi> what was the <hi>next</hi> ſucceſſive <hi>Head but one</hi> to the Imperial, that was up at the time of the Viſion. For, <hi>beſides</hi> the Ten Kings, there was to be an <hi>Head</hi> amongſt them, whom they ſhould <hi>all join with;</hi> And the Ten Kings were <hi>but</hi> ſo many different <hi>Horns,</hi> which ſignify a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Empire, and <hi>not a ſingle ſucceſſive Head of it</hi> ſuperior to them all, which is here enquired after, according to the <hi>mark</hi> that has already been given to know an Head by.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. This would alſo be another difficulty againſt deferring the appearance of the Beaſt till the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> viz. That the Reign of the Beaſt, and the time of the Woman in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, do begin and end together; and the Woman is ſaid to fly into the Wilderneſs preſently after her delivery of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, that is, preſently after the Converſion of the Imperial Throne, 200 years before <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s time.</p>
                     <p>But it is by almoſt all agreed, that that firſt mention of the Woman's flying into the Wilderneſs, is an anticipation, becauſe after ſeveral great Actions intervening, it is repeated again at the 14th verſe; and there repreſented but as a preparation to reſt in the Wilderneſs; and then the Dragon <hi>caſt out a flood after her,</hi> whilſt ſhe was flying, ſo that ſhe was not at reſt then, till after that flood was ſwallowed up by the Earth, which was juſt before the riſing of the Beaſt out of the Sea, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. In the <hi>laſt place</hi> it may be objected, That from the fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire in <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> to the time of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> was no new <hi>Roman</hi> Government in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> becauſe the Barbarous Kings,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:204884:142"/> and their People, were not <hi>Romans,</hi> and therefore muſt, if any thing, be a <hi>new Beaſt,</hi> and not a <hi>new Head</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt; and then all the time of their Reign will be but an <hi>Interregnum</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government; and <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s return there, will be but the continuance of the Sixth Head.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſufficient anſwer to this, that the ten Barbarous Kings which are made to be the Ten Horns of the Beaſt, are thereby repreſented as Members of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as has been juſt now obſerved: And moreover it does appear, that the <hi>Goths,</hi> who ſucceeded in the room of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Emperors, had been long before made the Confederates, and Members of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>See</hi> Note <hi rend="sup">y</hi>, on Chap. 4.</p>

It is in the next place very near as extravagant to grant, That ſome particular ſtate of <hi>Roman</hi> Rule, muſt be the great object of theſe Viſions; and yet to make the Figure of the Beaſt in general, to ſignifie the World, and the Heads of the <note place="margin">Ribera, &amp;c.</note> Beaſt either ſo many ſucceſſive Ages, or ſo many diſtinct ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Empires in it.</p>
                     <p>For by all the Examples of Beaſts and their Ruling parts all <note place="margin">Prop. 16.</note> over the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> (which is generally agreed to be
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:204884:145"/> the original pattern of the Prophecy of the Revelations) it is acknowledged by theſe very perſons themſelves, That a Beaſt does conſtantly ſignifie the Rule or Empire of <hi>one</hi> particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>only;</hi> and therefore muſt the Heads alſo ſignifie ſo many Supreme Powers in that Nation <hi>only.</hi> But the moſt inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing in this opinion is, That the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is granted by theſe ſame perſons to be nothing but the particular Nation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which yet is the exact picture <note place="margin">Prop. 15.</note> of this Beaſt in the Revelations.</p>
                     <p>But then to grant, <hi>3dly,</hi> That the Beaſt and his Heads do ſignifie nothing but <hi>Roman</hi> Power; and after that, to make the Seven Heads not to be ſo many <hi>diſtinct</hi> Powers, but to be taken <note place="margin">Bellarm. &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>collectively</hi> for <hi>All</hi> the Rulers of one kind, or for <hi>All</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, is to out-face the plain expreſſions of the Text, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the number <hi>Seven</hi> into <hi>Five, One, Another,</hi> and an <hi>Eighth</hi> that is one of the Seven; and it is well known, that when the number Seven is ſo expreſly divided into parts, it is never uſed collectively, or for an indefinite multitude.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As contrary to the known uſe of thoſe Myſtical Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is it to make the Seven Heads of the Beaſt to be ſo many <hi>ſingle perſons only</hi> of <hi>Rulers.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Grotius, &amp;c.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it is evident all over the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> That Heads and Horns of Beaſts do ſignify all the ſingle Perſons that Rule in that Diviſion, or Form of Government, that is ſignified by <note place="margin">Prop. 16.</note> each Head and each Horn.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And ſtill more inconſiſtent is it, to make the Beaſt and his Seven Heads to be <hi>Roman</hi> Powers, and yet Antichriſt, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Eighth King, which was one of the Seven, not to <note place="margin">Moſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.</note> come till after the end of all <hi>Roman</hi> Rule; or that the Fourth Beaſt in the Tenth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and yet the little Horn of that Beaſt not to appear till after the deſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                     <p>For this would make the little Horn of the Beaſt, to be no Horn of it, but to appear after the ruin of the Beaſt, whoſe Horn it is; which is a contradiction.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Of much the ſame nature, is that Abſurdity, That the Beaſt, called the 8th King, is Antichriſt, a little before the end of the World; and yet that <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is deſcribed to go all <note place="margin">The ſame.</note> along with it, and to be deſtroyed before it, is <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:204884:146"/> 7. Nor does it much help the matter, to affirm, That <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> does ſignifie both <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, and <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of Antichriſt, about the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>For by by <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. and 3. it is evident, That <hi>Babylon</hi> is in all <note place="margin">Ribera, &amp;c.</note> the mentions of it in the Revelations, one and the ſame ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Reign of the Beaſt, and in which it is deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That Opinion which makes the Heads of the Beaſt to be ſingle Perſons, and yet the Reign of the Beaſt to continue at <note place="margin">Grot. Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi> Prop. 6. and Coroll.</note> leaſt to the time of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> is inconſiſtent with the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the term of the Beaſt in the Prophecy, to the laſt Head of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if the Beaſt be nothing but the Beaſt under its laſt Head, and all the Seven Heads be but ſo many Succeſſions of ſingle Rulers only, it is impoſſible that the time of the Beaſt ſhould continue many years after the time of St. <hi>John,</hi> for the Sixth Head was then in Rule, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 10.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And upon the ſame grounds it is impoſſible, That the Ten Horns of the Beaſt ſhould be after the time of the laſt <note place="margin">Grot. Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi> Corol. 1. Prop. 12.</note> Head of the Beaſt; or that the time of the laſt Head of the Beaſt, ſhould be yet paſt, becauſe the Beaſt continues to the Second Coming of Chriſt, and is the ſame with the Reign of its laſt Head, <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. and its Corollaries.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Amongſt thoſe Opinions which make the Heads of the Beaſt to be ſo many Succeſſions of <hi>Roman</hi> Power, I could not entertain any of them about the <hi>conſtitutive difference</hi> of one Head from another, but that which made it to conſiſt only in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led change of the name of the Civil Power; becauſe that was the only known difference of Succeſſive Horns in <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch. 8. and of the five firſt Succeſſive Heads in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the only difference betwixt all kinds of Heads or Horns, upon the ſame Beaſt, <hi>whoſe ſignification is agreed on,</hi> is nothing but the different name of the Civil Power, either from its peculiar Terrritory in thoſe that are repreſented to rule all at a time, in a divided Monarchy, or from the different appellation in thoſe that ſucceed one another in an intire Empire. So is it above ſixty times in the agreed examples of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelations.</hi> See diſcourſe on Query the 2d.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I could not but look upon <hi>Alcaſar</hi>'s determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Seven Heads to Seven <hi>Roman</hi> Perſecutions of the Church, as arbitrary; and much more the opinion of thoſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:204884:146"/> Proteſtants, who agree that the only Conſtitutive Difference of the Six firſt Heads of the Beaſt, is nothing but a different name of the Civil Power; for they were all Six of the ſame <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> Dr. <hi>More.</hi>
                        </note> Religion); and yet will make the Two laſt Succeſſions of the Eight, which compleat the Seven Heads, to be nothing but Two Changes of Religion under the ſame Civil Head with the Sixth. For this is to make a new Rule for the difference of the Two laſt Succeſſions, without any ground for it from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and contrary to all the known and acknowledged Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, either in the reſt of the Heads of the ſame Beaſt, or in the Heads and Horns of other Beaſts; and gives great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Papiſts to deſpiſe the Proteſtants Application. The Pleas for it may be ſeen anſwered, in Anſwer to Objection 1, 2, 3, againſt the 2<hi>d Query.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11.

Thus is <hi>Babylon</hi> ſaid to be fallen, chap. 14. 8. to ſignifie the decay of the Power of the <hi>Image;</hi> and the Beaſt in the 17th chapter is ſaid to have the Power and Strength of the Ten Kings given him, which belongs properly to the <hi>Image</hi> of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. It ſeems to be a very unnatural force upon the Text, to make the Seventh King none of the Seven Heads, in chap. <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>More,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 17. 10.</p>
                     <p>For it is manifeſtly reckon'd up in order, as one of thoſe Seven Kings, which in the beginning of that verſe, are ſaid to be the Seven Heads; and without making it one of the Seven Heads, there will be but Six Heads upon the Beaſt in the 13th chapter. <note place="margin">Prop. 4, &amp; 5.</note> For it is agreed that it was the Sixth King, and Sixth Head that was there wounded; and it muſt be the ſame Head that was <hi>ſeen</hi> healed; which alſo is agreed to be the Eighth King, and laſt Ruling Head: If therefore the Seventh King were no Head,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:204884:147"/> there would be no new Head after the Sixth, but only the Sixth healed of a wound, whereas there were Seven really diſtinct Heads <hi>ſeen</hi> upon the Beaſt.</p>

                     <p>But a much more apparent ſhift is it in thoſe, who think themſelves forced <hi>to</hi> own the Beaſt to be but one ſingle Nation only, or the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and the laſt ruling Head <hi>to be</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt <note place="margin">Bellarm. &amp;c.</note> about the end of the World; and the Head in Rule at the time of the Viſion, <hi>to be</hi> the Imperial Government; but after all this for fear of bringing in Antichriſt into the <hi>Roman</hi> Church too ſoon, <hi>to make</hi> the Seven Heads to ſignifie <hi>collectively,</hi> all the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors either at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or at <hi>Vienna;</hi> whereas the number <hi>Seven</hi> is apparently here divided into broken numbers, which does as certainly determine the Heads to that definite number in an immediate Succeſſion to one another.

For the firſt ſix Heads were all of the ſame Religion, that is, Pagans: And upon this account is it, that moſt of them are forced to make the firſt appearance of the Beaſt to be of a very uncertain date; that is, according to their fancy about the firſt great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Papal Power, which cannot well be fixed: Whereas the firſt Riſe of the Beaſt muſt have been a very viſible and remarkable Change of the Supream Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> from that which was the 7th Ruling Power of it to the 8th, called the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>It is upon this account, that ſome of thoſe who incline to the former Opinion, and yet do plainly ſee, that the Beaſt muſt be a Change of the form of the Civil Power of the Empire, do therefore make the Ten Kings with the Papal Power, to be the Beaſt, that is, the Eighth King, or laſt Ruling Head.

                           <hi>Beaſt to confirm the firſt date of his Reign. A Caution to thoſe who have taken up with a former Hypotheſis. The uncouth Compoſition of the Beaſt, of the Parts of</hi> a Lyon, <hi>of</hi> a Leopard, <hi>and</hi> of a Bear, <hi>applied to an abſolute exactneſs.

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFTER the more cloſe and demonſtrative way of proof, that has been made uſe of to determine the particular nature, and firſt Riſe of the Beaſt, It will much confirm the knowledge that is now had of him, to ſee how eaſie and natural the Application of all the other Circumſtances of his Hiſtory will appear to be upon this foundation.</p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:204884:150"/>
                     <p> And this may ſerve for an additional proof <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> as the Demonſtrations of the principles of natural things by their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are much ſtrengthned by their perfect agreement with all the effects that we can apply them to, or with all that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does teach us of them. But yet it muſt always be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, That though the Application of an Inſtance or two ſhould ſeem to be ſomething harſh, or forced; That no man ought for that to queſtion the former Concluſions, unleſs upon a new examination he can find them <hi>leſs neceſſary,</hi> than they did at firſt appear. <hi>No man ought to doubt of a plain and manifeſt truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees it to be ſeemingly inconſiſtent with ſome other Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are deduced from it,</hi> which are not ſo plain and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                     <p>I know not of any ſuch harſhneſs in any of the Applications that I am now going to make, but rather think them ſo well agreeing with the Characters of the Text, that they are enough to ſurprize one into an admiration of the Congruity of them. But I interpoſe this as a convenient Caution to thoſe who may find a convincing evidence in the proof of the maint Point, to which the Applications are fixed; but by reaſon of ſome preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and long uſe of a former Hypotheſis, may not think ſome of the Applications ſo well fitted to the Prophecy, as they will imagine their own to be. For this will be apt to make them judge many things, which to all others would appear <hi>very tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable at leaſt,</hi> to be harſh and uncouth to them.</p>
                     <p>To begin then with the figure and compoſition of the Beaſt; It is ſaid to be in the ſeveral parts of it like a <hi>Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Leopard,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 2.</note> and a <hi>Bear,</hi> which do manifeſtly refer to its being the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is there repreſented immediately after the account of the Three Kingdoms ſhown by <note place="margin">v. 7, 23.</note> thoſe Three Beaſts, and is ſaid to have devoured them. And thoſe Three Beaſts are agreed to be the <hi>Babylonian, Perſian</hi> and <note place="margin">Book the IId.</note> 
                        <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchies: The Beaſt here is repreſented as conſiſting of theſe Kingdoms, as the parts of his Body; which if it has any reference to the <hi>Roman</hi> State at the particular Riſe of the Beaſt with <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> muſt ſignify, That it ſhould be that particular <hi>Roman</hi> Power which was in poſſeſſion of <hi>Greece, Babylon</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> or that part of <hi>Aſia</hi> which belonged to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> And then it does very clearly ſignify, That the Riſe of the Beaſt ſhould be at the advancement of the <hi>Eaſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:204884:150"/> to the Government of <hi>Rome?</hi> And does not that ſuit well enough with <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt of <hi>Italy?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This would tempt one to be very confident, That this was deſigned as a very plain Character to know the Riſe of the Beaſt by, ſince there is no ſuch mention of any of the Parts of theſe Beaſts, in the Dragon in the Chapter juſt before, which yet is the ſame kind of Figure with this, and is known to ſignify the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> State <hi>a long time after</hi> that it had been in poſſeſſion of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> And one would be very apt to judge, That what is repreſented as <hi>particular</hi> to the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter, and was omitted in the Dragon, which yet is known to be the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, muſt be added as a mark of diſtinction of the one from the other. But if others will have this mark of the Three Beaſts to belong to the general nature of the Beaſt, as it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſt at its firſt appearance after the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy, it will not prejudice my Opinion. It is enough to ſhow, That as this Beaſt does ſignify the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate of it under its laſt Ruling Head; So this character of the Parts of it does <hi>moſt exactly</hi> agree with that, which I make to be the laſt Ruling Head at its firſt Riſe, <hi>in diſtinction</hi> to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtates of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>riſing of the Beaſt out of the Sea,</hi> is known to ſignify, that it <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 1.</note> ſhould ariſe out of great Commotions, and by great Wars and Tumults. For ſo are <hi>many Waters</hi> interpreted by the Angel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſignify in this Prophecy, chap. 17. 15. <hi>Multitudes, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 7. &amp; 17. 12. Jer. 46. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>and Tongues, and Nations,</hi> which being added to the nature of thoſe <hi>Waters in the Sea,</hi> do determine it to ſignify great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of thoſe <hi>Multitudes,</hi> and <hi>Nations.</hi> And certainly this does very well ſuit with that ſtrange buſtle which <hi>Juſtinian</hi> made in the World by his Wars with the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> and with his Conqueſts of thoſe People at his taking poſſeſſion of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire. <hi>The aſcending of the Beaſt out of the Bottomleſs Pit,</hi> Rev. 17. 8. is the ſame thing; as the Sea is uſually called by the name of the <hi>Abyſs</hi> in Scripture, which is the word here uſed for the <hi>Bottomleſs Pit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could never meet with any ſatisfactory Account from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> concerning the date of the firſt appearance of the Beaſt, why the whole time of its continuance, both in <hi>Daniel,</hi>

                           <p>All the Perſecutions of the Church are ſet out by three years and an half. Three days and an half refer to a Week. <hi>And on chap.</hi> 12.

We have alſo there ſeen, that the ſpace of three years and an half is to be taken myſtically, and that by it is ſignified in the middle of a week of ſeven years.</p>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>the three, and an half,</hi> in that expreſſion, muſt have a reference to ſome <hi>ſeven,</hi> as the whole number of it. <hi>Three years, and an half,</hi> is in it ſelf ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and unuſual a determination of the whole time of a thing; and the whole number <hi>ſeven,</hi> ſo commonly uſed in the Old and New Teſtament, to ſignify the <hi>whole</hi> of things of the ſame kind, that it muſt be thought to be very likely to be here referred to; <hi>eſpecially,</hi> when it is alſo conſidered, That the number <hi>ſeven</hi> is very frequently in uſe all over the Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe: Alcaſar</hi> has obſerved, that it is made uſe of there no leſs than forty times. <hi>Epiſt. Dedicat. Comment. in</hi> Apocalyp.</p>
                     <p>The three years and an half, of the preaching of Chriſt, to which theſe three years and an half, are ſaid to allude, are alſo in the 9th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> laſt verſe, made to be a reference to half a week of years.</p>
                     <p>With this it is alſo to be obſerved, That the other two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prophecies concerning the Captivities of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church (which is every-where made the ſcheme of the Chriſtian Church.) The firſt about the 70 years Captivity by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the 70 weeks Captivity, till the time of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (which is mentioned with the former in the 9th Chapter of <hi>Daniel)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> They both have the number <hi>ſeven</hi> for their <hi>denominator,</hi> and common meaſure. And from <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>ſeven years</hi> ſervice for <note place="margin">Gen. 29. &amp; Chap. 21. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> and from the Liberty of an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Servant at the end of <hi>ſeven years;</hi> It appears, that the ſpace of <hi>ſeven years</hi> was the known ſpace of time for <hi>ſervitude</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> where the Prophecies were delivered. And the ſeven years that we are now enquiring after to fix the half of them to, muſt be ſome ſeven years of the Bondage of the Church, though with ſome lightſome intervals.</p>
                     <p>As this does make it very likely, That the <hi>Time, Times, and an half,</hi> of the Tyranny of the Little Horn, or Beaſt, over the Church of God, does certainly refer to ſome whole number of ſeven Times: ſo is it now worth the enquiring, to what <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſeven</hi> Prophetical Times they are referred.</p>
                     <p>This difficulty in the way, that I have found my ſelf deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to by the Prophecy, is eaſily reſolved. For if the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Beaſt be at <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt of <hi>Italy, the Time, Times, and half,</hi> of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and Little Horn of the Beaſt in <hi>Daniel,</hi> are juſt as long a ſpace of time, as it was
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:204884:151"/> from the firſt beginning of the Captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> (who were much the ſame Kingdom with the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians)</hi> in the 9th year of the Reign of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> to the time of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that Captivity of the Ten Tribes, by <hi>Salmanaſar,</hi> was in <note place="margin">

Part. 2. l. 1. c. 4. in fine.</note> the 3993d year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period, and 720 years before Chriſt. If to this be added the Year of our Lord, when <hi>Beliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> carried <hi>Vitiges,</hi> the King of the <hi>Italian Goths,</hi> in triumph with him to <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> which was <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 540, there will be juſt the ſame number of 1260 years to the beginning of the Reign of the Beaſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the firſt half of the ſeven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical <hi>years of years,</hi> without their <hi>Epagomena,</hi> or the five days at the end of them, as is determined in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> And tho the <hi>Goths</hi> did after that Triumph of <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> get head again in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet the example that we have of the computation of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Petav.</hi> Rat. Temp. part. 2. l. 3. c. 12.</note> the 70 years Captivity, from the firſt carrying away of <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi> long before the final Deſolation, is a very plain Rule given for the fixing of the date of the Conqueſt of a Nation in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. For <hi>Beliſarius</hi>'s Conqueſt of the <hi>Goths</hi> at the taking of <hi>Vitiges</hi> their King, was exactly the ſame kind of Conqueſt of them, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Conqueſt of <hi>Judaea</hi> at the carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their King <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> in Fetters, though the Line of their Kings continued to the end of <hi>Zedekiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this it appears, That from the <hi>firſt times</hi> of the Bondage of God's Church at the beginning of the great Captivity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the laſt end of it at the ruine of the Fourth Kingdom in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſucceeded there by the Kingdom of the <hi>Son of Man;</hi> there is juſt the ſpace of ſeven Prophetical years, or in the phraſe of <hi>Daniel, ſeven Times,</hi> of which <hi>the one half begins</hi> with the Captivity of the Ten Tribes, and <hi>ends</hi> at the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Reign of the Beaſt; and <hi>the other half</hi> is the times of that Reign. At the end of which the great Prophetical Week of Times is accompliſhed, or the times of the Servitude and Bondage of the People of God: For as ſeven years was the allotted time in the Law for the ſlavery of a Servant, ſo did that time ſeem to be made the Type of this great ſtate of Bondage.</p>
                     <p>To confirm this, We ſee the end of the <hi>Time, Times, and half,</hi> declared to be the end of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Captivity, <hi>Daniel</hi> 12. 7. Which does clearly ſhow, that thoſe Times were only a part of that <hi>whole</hi> Captivity; and where they appear to be the juſt half,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:204884:152"/> and to be called <hi>three, and an half,</hi> who would not aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they muſt refer to the whole number of <hi>ſeven Times, or years of years,</hi> which was the whole time of that Captivity?</p>
                     <p>And thus comes the whole time of that long Captivity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be meaſured out to our admiration by theſe two halves of it, from the firſt time of the Captivity of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as the 70 years from the firſt Captivity of <hi>Jehoiakim)</hi> to the Riſe of the Beaſt, or Little Horn, and from the beginning of that Reign, to the end of it.</p>
                     <p>But if the 1260 years in both the halves ſhould be alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted without the five days, or the <hi>Epagomena,</hi> at the end of each year in them, juſt as three times, or three years, and an half, are here but 1260 days, then they would be 18 years ſhort of that number of years; and then the firſt half of the whole ſeven would end juſt about <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s entrance upon the Throne in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or at <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s being crowned by Pope <hi>John,</hi> four years before, in acknowledgment of his Right over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And this might be ſo much a more remarkable date of the Riſe of the Beaſt, becauſe this is ſaid by <hi>Petavius, Ration. Temp. Part. I. L.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. to have been the firſt Inſtance of the Crowning of an Emperor by the Pope. And this was near 18 years before the other date from <hi>Beliſarius</hi>'s Triumph over the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings, and made remarkable by the change of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Aera ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. C.</hi> for that of the year of our Lord preſently after by <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus;</hi> and by the beginning of a new <hi>Digeſt</hi> and <hi>Code</hi> of Laws by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> which have continued ever ſince to be the acknowledged ſtandard of Civil Law to all Nations, though properly nothing but the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                     <p>The other half alſo of the Time, or the 1260 years of the Beaſt, muſt thereupon be concluded to end 18 years ſooner, or ſoon after the Year 1760.</p>
                     <p>It has indeed been already determined, that the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Beaſt was at <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt of the <hi>Goths.</hi> But though his firſt publick formal appearance might be <hi>not till then,</hi> yet the time of his Reign might very well be accounted from the time of his firſt Inauguration, or Coronation, for that Deſign, by the Falſe Prophet, ſince it ſeemed to be but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Deſign for the Elevation of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Emperor into the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Throne. And ſo was that Action of Pope <hi>John</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> as a tranſlation of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:204884:152"/> upon him; and upon that account was the Pope ſo cloſely impriſoned at his return by the King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> as it coſt him his life. The firſt date then of the 42 months of the Beaſt's Reign, may very well begin at his firſt Coronation by the Pope, as the <hi>Eighth King</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the ſeven Hills.</p>
                     <p>But after all, it is to be obſerved, That there is an apparent ground from the Prophecy for the apprehending the two halves of the <hi>ſeven times</hi> of years not to be altogether of an equal length. The mention of a <hi>Time, Times, and an half,</hi> is indeed ground enough to make one conclude, that they refer to an <hi>whole week of times,</hi> of which they are three and an half. But then to ſhew, that this latter half was of a different length from the other three and an half before them; theſe latter are induſtriouſly explained in the <hi>Revelations</hi> to be no more than three years and an half without the five days, which were uſually added to the twelve <hi>Babylonian</hi> Months in every year: Which ſeems to be a plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception there put in to diſtinguiſh them from all other Accounts of <hi>Babylonian</hi> years, that had not that limitation added to them, and therefore more particularly to ſhew their difference from the firſt three and an half in the <hi>ſeven times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to this, The firſt three times and an half, ought to be accounted according to the <hi>full</hi> number of days in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> year, or with the addition of the five days, or <hi>Epago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> after the other Twelve Months; which would make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of theſe firſt half of the ſeven Times to contain five days more in it, than is accounted in every one of the latter half: And then the firſt Three Prophetical Times and an half before the Reign of the Beaſt would be 17 years more than 1260 full years; which would make them reach from the firſt <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Captivity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the year 558 after Chriſt, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Petav.</hi> Rat. Temp. l. 7: c. 5. in fine.</note> when <hi>Beliſarius</hi> made an end of the laſt remainder of all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Conqueſt of the Weſtern Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nation of the <hi>Huns;</hi> the Times of the Reign of the Beaſt, the latter half would by this account not begin till about the year 558: and if they were full 1260 <hi>Babylonian</hi> years, they would then reach to about the year 1820 for their Laſt End. But by the ſame reaſon, that they are made to be but 1260 years, or 17 years ſhort of the full account of the three Times and an half; <note place="margin">N. B.</note> every of thoſe 1260 years as has been obſerved, may be judged
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:204884:153"/> to want five days in them; and then they would reach but to juſt the year 1800.</p>
                     <p>And this I account to be the true way of determining the number of the years in both the halves of the <hi>Week of Times</hi> here referred to. For the induſtrious care, that the Prophecy ſeems to take in three Chapters of the <hi>Revelations</hi> to limit the number of years contained in the latter half of that great week, is ſufficient ground to conclude, that the former half of it before the Times of the Beaſt, which has no ſuch limitation in it, is to be accounted according to the received Cuſtom of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Nation, for their number of days in a year, to which all this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar calculation of the Times does refer. For the Exception expreſly put in to the one half, is a confirmation of the common way of account in the other half, where there is none.</p>
                     <p>Thus may we obſerve, That this great Tribulation of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Beaſt, does in that reſemble the time of the greateſt Tribulation that ever befel the <hi>Jews,</hi> as it is characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by our Saviour. The days that this ſhould have in it in proportion to the other half of the ſeven before it, are <hi>ſhortned for the Elects ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And all the grounds that there are for the ſhortning of the length of 1260 years by the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Account, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the additional five days, expreſly referred to in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, do alſo prove, that the Riſe of the Beaſt, whoſe time is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out by theſe years, could not be about the Year 450. for then his time would now have been almoſt juſt run out. For 1260 <hi>Chaldaick</hi> years would be but 1242, which added to 450, would make but 1692 for the end of the Beaſt. And yet that is the time to which the firſt Riſe of the Beaſt is fixed by the moſt Judicious of the Proteſtants, that take other ways for the ſucceſſion of the Eighth King, called The Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>But in the ſhorteſt account of theſe years they appear however to be ſo prodigious a length of time for the Reign of One Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Kingdom over the Church of God, in compariſon with any other of the Four Monarchies (by which the whole <note place="margin">N.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:204884:153"/> of it in the laſt Monarchy of the Four, as long as all the reſt of the time of the ſlavery of the Church under all the other Three Monarchies, and that alſo in but the one part of the Fourth Monarchy.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Character of an</hi> Eighth, which was one of the Seven, <hi>explained; of</hi> was, <hi>and</hi> is not, yet is; <hi>Of coming after a</hi> Seventh, <hi>which ſhould</hi> continue but a ſhort ſpace: <hi>Of the</hi> changing of Times, and Laws: <hi>Of the</hi> Ten Kings <hi>reigning</hi> one hour with the Beaſt: <hi>Of the</hi> Image of the Beaſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO go on with the reſt of the Characters of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> The Imperial Head cut off by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and reſtored by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> does very naturally agree with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of its being an <hi>Eighth King, which was one</hi> of the <hi>Seven.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 11.</note> it was the Sixth of thoſe Seven Kings at the time of the Prophecy, and an Eighth in the time of its Reſtauration by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian.</hi> And it is a ſtrange thing to ſee how others are forced to make <hi>either</hi> their Eighth King to be the ſame with their Seventh, <hi>or</hi> their Seventh King to be none of the ſeven Heads, to uphold their Interpretation.</p>
                     <p>And that alſo ſhows, How the Imperial Head reſtored by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> was the Head <hi>wounded to death, and healed again;</hi> ch. 13. 3. And the Beaſt that <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> and <hi>yet is,</hi> ch. 17. 8. which do but ſignify the ſame thing with its being the <hi>Eighth, which was one of the Seven</hi> that had been once paſt before. For all thoſe Expreſſions ſignify no more, than that the Imperial Head <hi>was,</hi> before it was deadly wounded by the <hi>Goths, then ceaſed to be,</hi> while the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings were the Kings of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and afterwards <hi>was healed again</hi> by the return of the Imperial Rule over <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Juſtinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where by the way may be obſerved, how juſtly the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Imperial Power in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> after the ruine of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, does anſwer the Character of, <hi>and yet is,</hi> at the time when it had but a ſmall ſhare in the Authority of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings. See the Account of their <note place="margin">Note 20, 21. on Chap. 18.</note> Union in the choice of their Conſuls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whereas the firſt of theſe Expreſſions ſeems to belong <hi>only to an Head</hi> of the Beaſt, and <hi>the other</hi> is ſaid of the Beaſt <hi>indefinitely;</hi> It is to be conſidered,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:204884:154"/> that the notion of the Beaſt, is the Beaſt in the particular ſtate of its laſt Head <hi>(Prop.</hi> 6.)—which is the healed Head <hi>(Coroll.</hi> 3. <hi>Prop.</hi> 10.)</p>
                     <p>As for the Riddle of <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> and <hi>yet is,</hi> The Learned <note place="margin">Vol. 1. p. 642.</note> Dr. <hi>More</hi> has ſhown, that that is to be underſtood of the Beaſt, as it was ſubject to thoſe ſeveral changes of one and the ſame ſtate of it, and not to be tied to any one ſet particular time, when thoſe inconſiſtent Characters were really verified of it <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,</hi> as ſeveral compounded Names of things are found to be in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> For to underſtand it literally of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Beaſt, is an open contradiction; or to underſtand thoſe Characters about the ſame qualification of it in <hi>the ſame</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at the ſame time. And yet it cannot but be ſeen, that in the time of the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings, it was very near being verified to the greateſt nicety about the Imperial Government. It <hi>was</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream at <hi>Rome before</hi> them, it <hi>was not</hi> ſo <hi>in</hi> their time; <hi>and yet it was</hi> owned for its ſhare <hi>with</hi> them in the Authority of it.</p>
                     <p>But to make out this difficulty by applying theſe Expreſſions only to a quality of the Beaſt, that <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>was not,</hi> and <hi>yet was</hi> (as Dr. <hi>More</hi> does to the Idolatry of the <hi>Romans)</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which has been proved to be the conſtant accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Beaſt <hi>(Prop.</hi> 6)—that is, The particular ſtate of it under the Eighth King, which therefore muſt be the thing of which, <hi>was, is not,</hi> and <hi>yet is,</hi> muſt be verified.</p>
                     <p>The Character of his being an <hi>Eighth</hi> after a Seventh King, <hi>which ſhould continue but a ſhort ſpace,</hi> agrees very well with the <note place="margin">Ch. 17. 10.</note> Reſtauration of the Imperial Rule after the Reign of the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> For their whole time was not above ſeventy years, which <note place="margin">Iſa. 23. 15.</note> is but the Age of one Man, and is by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> called the days of one King; and is a very ſhort ſpace of time in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with thoſe Kings betwixt whom it ſtands, and to whoſe time of Reign the reference is made. For thoſe ſeventy years were as nothing in compariſon of either the Imperial Rule <hi>before</hi> it, which had continued for above five hundred years; or of that <hi>after</hi> it, which has already continued above a thouſand years. And beſides, it is a ſhorter ſpace of time than is attributed to the Seventh King, by almoſt all others who do not make him to be a ſingle Emperor.</p>
                     <p>The changing of <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> attributed to the Little Horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi> may ſignify no more than appearing like a new
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:204884:155"/> Lawgiver in the Church. But if it be deſired to ſee this more particularly verified of the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> Is it not ſufficient for that purpoſe, that His <hi>Code</hi> was then made the ſtanding Law of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and has ever ſince continued to be ſo? And that the <hi>Epocha,</hi> that <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus</hi> did then bring in of the Year of our Lord, againſt the old <hi>Epocha ab urbe conditâ,</hi> has ever ſince been obſerved? But I rather ſtick to his Settlement of the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>There is no manner of difficulty about the Ten Kings, which <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 12.</note> are ſaid to Reign with the Beaſt either <hi>one hour,</hi> or <hi>at the ſame time.</hi> For the number Ten is uſually taken in Scripture for an uncertain multitude of thoſe things of which it is ſaid to be the number; and in ſuch a long ſucceſſion, and change of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as it is here joined with, and where there is no other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to ſhew it to be a definite number, it ought in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be taken in that ſenſe; that is, for an uncertain multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Kingdoms, that were to be ſet up with the Beaſt in the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, according as they are repreſented by Horns of that Beaſt, which is agreed to be the particular <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monarchy, <hi>Prop.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>For it is unimaginable, That ever that definite number of Ten Kingdoms ſhould be found to have been conſtant under all thoſe Changes of Maſters, that the Diviſions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire have have been ſucceſſively ruled by. I am ſure in the time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy in <hi>England,</hi> it could not be ſo: And many other Inſtances of the like nature might be produced againſt it. But however, it is not queſtioned by thoſe, who maintain the definite number, but that theſe Ten Kings were up in Rule <hi>at the ſame time</hi> with <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> That they ſhould have their firſt Riſe with him <hi>at one</hi> and <hi>the ſame time,</hi> is not at all neceſſary from the Text, though the ſignification of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſhould be granted to be <hi>at the ſame time.</hi> See pag. 216.</p>
                     <p>But indeed the common, and unforced ſignification of that Expreſſion, is <hi>one hour,</hi> that is, a ſmall time, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: And then all that could be made of it, would be, That thoſe Ten Kings, which are ſaid to have received no Kingdom in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, <hi>yet ſhould receive power as Kings,</hi> or as free In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Sovereigns, for a ſmall time with the Beaſt; and that only, till, as it is ſaid, they ſhould <hi>give their power, and ſtrength, and Kingdoms to the Beaſt;</hi> that is, Till they ſhould ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:204884:155"/> and their Kingdoms to that <hi>Roman</hi> Uſurpation, which the Imperial Authority ſhould ſet up, and be the Secular Head of; which will be better underſtood, when it is explained what the <hi>worſhip of the Beaſt,</hi> and of his <hi>Image,</hi> is.</p>
                     <p>For that end it will be now requiſite to enquire what the <hi>Image of the Beaſt</hi> can be determined to be. It ſeems at firſt to <note place="margin">Chap. 13, 14.</note> be a figurative Expreſſion, and ſo capable of variety of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations; but there will be peculiar marks enough found of it in the Text to determine it to one certain thing.</p>
                     <p>But before we enter upon that, it is to be premiſed, That the mention of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and his <hi>Image,</hi> is a very manifeſt alluſion to the <note n="b" place="margin">

The Emperor's Image, and the worſhip given to it, was the publick ſignification of his being in power: And that they might have the fairer Title to Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note n="c" place="margin">
                           <hi>Panciroll.</hi> pag. 47. <hi>Notit. Imp. Orient.</hi> ſhews the way of conſecrating the Images of the Emperours, and the unlawfulneſs of ſelling them after it; no leſs than <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> or High-Treaſon.</note> they were conſecrated with a form of words, as the Idols that were dedicated to the honour of the Gods: And ſo ſacred were they after that, accounted to be, that it was High-treaſon for any to ſell them after Conſecration.</p>
                     <p>The Beaſt then, and his Image, are here joined together with a reference to the worſhip of the Emperors, and their Images. <hi>The Falſe Prophet,</hi> who is the contriver of this Image, has been already found to be a Church-Head with Supream Authority over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that he is <hi>really</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the Beaſt, who is the Secular Head of it. <hi>Prop.</hi> 24.</p>
                     <p>And this Falſe Prophet is determined to be in particular, the Papal Authority, <hi>(Coroll.</hi> 3. <hi>Prop.</hi> 25.)</p>
                     <p>The Characters of this Image in the Text are to be next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid to be the <hi>Image of the firſt Beaſt, which had the deadly</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>wound, and was healed again.</hi> It was then the Image of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial <hi>Roman</hi> Rule reſtored again by <hi>Juſtinian, Coroll.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp; Query</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>an Image</hi> of any thing, is ſomething made after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the thing of which it is the Image; And particularly, in this Caſe it muſt have as great a likeneſs to its Original, as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:204884:156"/> the Images of the Emperors uſed to have to the Emperors themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But then this Image is different from all Carved Images of the Emperors: For it is ſaid to <hi>have life</hi> put into it; and therefore muſt it be a <hi>living</hi> likeneſs to its Original. That which it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, is the Imperial <hi>Roman</hi> State, which is ſaid to have power over all <hi>Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations.</hi> This Image then muſt alſo be a <hi>living Supream Power over all tbe ſame Juriſdiction;</hi> for otherwiſe it cannot be a living likeneſs of the former. A Carved Image is indeed but the dead likeneſs of ſome ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But an Image of a Publick State, <hi>that is alive,</hi> as this is, muſt be ſome Ruling Power in the ſame State, that has a very <hi>lively reſemblance</hi> to it; for it is in being at the ſame time with it; the Beaſt and his Image are ordinarily deſcribed to be together. And the Image is made in honour of the Beaſt, and ſo muſt, like the Images of the Emperors, be within the bounds of the Authority of the Beaſt; And beſides, is made by a Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the exerciſe of the Power of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>living Image</hi> then, muſt neceſſarily be an Univerſal Rule of the World, like to that of the Imperial <hi>Roman</hi> State. And accordingly we find it <hi>ſpeaking, and commanding all the World to worſhip it,</hi> chap. 13. 15. <hi>forcing all men to receive the mark of it, and to take the name of it,</hi> v. 16. which ſhows the extent of its Power to be as large as that of the Imperial Power, its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. It had alſo power of life and death in it, v. 15.—which is the peculiar Prerogative of Supream Power.</p>
                     <p>Now this was all for nothing elſe but the enforcing of Falſe Worſhip, which it was inſpired with life by a falſe Prophet to effect. And one of the Puniſhments was Excommunication, <note place="margin">v. 14. v. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>That men might not buy or ſell,</hi> which was an uſual puniſhment <note n="d" place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Wherein the Worſhip of the Beast, and of his Image, doth conſiſt.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BY the proceſs of the former Chapter we have all the Confederates in the deſign of the Beaſt diſcovered to us. There is the Imperial <hi>Roman</hi> State for the <hi>Beaſt with his laſt Head;</hi> The <hi>Image and falſe Prophet</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church, and the Pope. <hi>The ten Kings giving their Kingdoms to the Beaſt;</hi> for thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Kings, who <hi>force</hi> their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſubmit to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, enjoyned by the Papal Power, or Imperial Authority.</p>
                     <p>And now it is to be examined, what is meant by Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beaſt, and his Image.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, in the firſt place, That the words here uſed to expreſs the Worſhip of the Beaſt, and his Image, are the ſame with thoſe which were in uſe at the time of the Viſion, to ſignifie the Adoration given to the Emperors, and their Images, publickly ſet up. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <hi>adorare</hi> were the terms, in common uſe amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> of thoſe times to expreſs that profound Reverence which was paid to the Emperor and his Image. And then there ſeems to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more required to make Application of this Phraſe, but only to ſhow what obedience was given to the <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> Authority of <hi>Rome,</hi> by all the World, from the time of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe we find that the <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>GRotius in Decal.]</hi> Nor did the firſt Chriſtians think it contrary to their Religion to fall down before the Emperours Images: But when they afterwards joined the Images of falſe Gods with their own, they choſe to endure any thing, rather than to worſhip them.</note> firſt Chriſtians did pay that Reverence before-mentioned to the Emperors and their Images, as well as the <hi>Pagans;</hi> It is manifeſt, that there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more here meant, than a bare external Civil Veneration of the higher Powers as the Ordinance of God.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be ſomething very much like the Worſhipping of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, and of thoſe <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings, in ſuch a manner, as not to be allowed the exerciſe of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And nothing leſs than this, can anſwer the Character of the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 4. who is ſaid to <hi>exalt himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped: So that be as God ſitteth</hi>
                        <pb n="250" facs="tcp:204884:158"/> 
                        <hi>in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf, that he is God.</hi> And by the conſent of all Interpreters, that Prophecy does certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that ſtate of things that is repreſented by the Beaſt and his Image.</p>
                     <p>By this then it appears, that <hi>by the Worſhip</hi> here mentioned, muſt be underſtood, the <hi>giving of Divine honours,</hi> or the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Prerogatives of God, or Chriſt, to the Beaſt, or his Image; that is, to the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Authority of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> after the Reſtauration of the Imperial <hi>Roman</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>The unqueſtionable way to effect this, would be to make <note n="*" place="margin">Grot. <hi>Reſponſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Antichriſto, pag.</hi> 77. I deteſt every thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Spirit of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; (that is, the impoſing, perſecuting Spirit.) And that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> but about the Lake <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> and in other places.</note> the Arbitrary will and pleaſure of the Supreme Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, or the Church, to be acknowledged for the Law of God, Divinely inſpired, or to be publickly obeyed as ſuch by outward compliance with it: This is certainly to ſet up ones own will for the will of God; and ſo to ſtand ones ſelf in the place of God to the World. And if this be exerciſed with an irreſiſtible power over the Univerſal Church of Chriſt upon Earth, it is plainly the <hi>ſhowing</hi> ones ſelf <hi>to be a God in the Temple of God.</hi> For there could nothing elſe be underſtood by the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,</hi> after the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the Chriſtian Church, which alſo has that name in ſeveral places of the ſame Apoſtle's Writings.</p>
                     <p>A ſtill much higher improvement of this Worſhip is it, if it be enjoined as <hi>neceſſary to Salvation</hi> to believe theſe Arbitrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to be the Inſpirations of God, and to obey them.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>eſpecially</hi> if theſe Decrees be not only about things left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different by the Word of God, but are alſo Injunctions <hi>contrary</hi> to the Will and Word of God; For this is to <hi>oppoſe</hi> and <hi>exalt ones ſelf above God in the Temple of God;</hi> And if this be done with the ſhew of the Authority of God himſelf in it, this is to <hi>oppoſe all that is called God, ſhewing himſelf to be God.</hi> For he does certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make himſelf very near as abſolute a Sovereign of a Nation, who does unjuſtly exerciſe all the Acts of the Sovereign Power of it, againſt the will of the undoubted Prince of it, but yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>his Authority,</hi> as he that does it by an open Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Title of the Sovereign Power.</p>
                     <p>This Power and Authority is carried on with a ſtill greater arrogance and claim of divinity in it, if it pretends to a Title of <hi>Infallibility</hi> in all that it can enjoin. For as this Divine Attribute
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:204884:158"/> is the fundamental ground of all the higheſt Acts of Faith in God; ſo is it a claim of an infinite power in men; and does give <note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Thomas de Albiis,</hi> in his <hi>Tabulae Suffragiales,</hi> does the beſt lay open the dreadful Conſequences of eſtabliſhing Infallibility in any Head of the Church, or any where, where it really is not. <hi>Tab.</hi> 20, 21. This Claim, in reference to the Pope, he proves there to be the Mother of all Hereſies, and the worſt of all ſins, becauſe if thoſe who claim it ſhould err, it would lead all the Church into the ſame, without any poſſibility of remedy. There is the ſame reaſon for that Claim in any Governing-part of the Church, where that Privilege really is not.</note> Authority to all the Acts of their own Will, frees them from <note place="margin">See Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> all Bounds and Meaſures, or Rules to diſtinguiſh betwixt Truth and Falſhood; ſets them out of the reach of all humane Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, and makes their Will and Pleaſure the laſt Appeal for all Controverſies; and their Arbitrary Deciſions to be the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God.</p>
                     <p>How inconſiderable does the Worſhip of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image appear to be, in compariſon with this profound Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul and Conſcience, given to the arbitrary, falſe and wicked Decrees of either ignorant or deſigning Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Character of the Word and Will of God?</p>
                     <p>And all theſe particulars are made good in the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, <hi>by the Imperial Laws,</hi> and their Sanctions, and Edicts, to force their own Faith in indifferent things.

                     </p>
                     <p>Of the ſame Nature is the exerciſe <hi>of the power of the Keys</hi> in that Church, by which they confine all Divine Favour, and all Right to the Kingdom of Heaven, to the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and only as <hi>Roman,</hi> and by which they pretend to have the Power of the Curſes of God, and of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation in their Hands, to pronounce againſt all thoſe who own not that Divine Authority, and Infallible Spirit in them, by which they appear, <hi>as in the place of God,</hi> in the Church.</p>
                     <p>For by this does the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> appear manifeſtly to <hi>ſit as a Goddeſs in the Church Catholick;</hi> to which all muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with all the outward Worſhip of their Bodies, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Veneration of their Souls, as the only Oracle of God,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:204884:159"/> in all its Deciſions and Definitions of Faith and Worſhip, and as the immediate Voice and Thunder of God from Heaven in all its Anathema's and Excommunications: And all this about matters, which <hi>either</hi> were never made to be the Will of God, by any other Authority, but the meer Will of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; <hi>Or</hi> which are known to be abſolutely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the revealed Will of God, <hi>the Light of Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and to the common Senſe and Reaſon of mankind, which is the <hi>Candle of the Lord;</hi> and the moſt fundamental <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 27.</note> Criterion of the Truth or Falſhood of Revelations or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations.</p>
                     <p>But ſome will queſtion, whether all this can amount to the charge of commanding Men to Worſhip the Beaſt and his Image with Divine Honours, tho theſe things ſhould be done without any warrant from God for them; becauſe God himſelf is intended for the only Object of all that Worſhip that is thus enjoyned.</p>
                     <p>This doubt may ſoon be reſolved by what Men would judge of the Worſhip of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, tho he ſhould have pretended, that it was the peculiar Preſence of the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as well as his own Image; and that it was to be Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the account of that immediate Union of the True God with himſelf and his Image. Or by what Men can think of the Worſhip given to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> under the ſuppoſition of his being the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> at ſeveral appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; Whether would the Adoration be excuſed, for being intended to the True God?</p>
                     <p>I would but demand of any ſorts of Chriſtians, what they would think of ſuch an unbounded Power as has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in any Party of Men, from whom they differ, which ſhould now ariſe with theſe Claims of Superiority and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the Univerſal Church of Chriſt upon Earth, and ſhould <hi>force</hi> Mens Conſciences to acknowledge theſe Claims to be due <hi>by Divine Right,</hi> and ſhould <hi>really</hi> think them to be ſo, upon as <hi>ſlight Grounds,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve its own pretences upon; and ſhould exerciſe theſe new powers with as zealous deſigns for God's Service, as they of that Church ſeem to do? It would be hardly poſſible for any of a differing Party to forbear the charging of this new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender with the Character of ſitting <hi>like a God in the Temple of</hi>
                        <pb n="253" facs="tcp:204884:159"/> 
                        <hi>God,</hi> or in the Chriſtian Church. For he that requires meer human Laws to be accounted Divine Inſpiration, which yet are nothing but his own will; he plainly makes his own will a Divine Law: And if he forces it upon all the World for ſuch, he makes his own will the Univerſal Lord of the Conſciences of Men, which is the peculiar Prerogative of God alone.</p>
                     <p>Without all queſtion, if the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of his <hi>Clergy,</hi> ſhould uſe the ſame methods and pretences that they have done to the Proteſtants, to force the Conſciences of the Papal Party all over the World to the Opinions of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, they would not ſtick to charge him with the Character of uſurping upon the peculiar Prerogative of God in his Church.</p>
                     <p>I do take it all this while for granted, That the Claim for this Univerſal Power in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Title of Infallibility, is unwarrantable; and that is ſo eaſie a thing to be ſatisfied about, that I think it not needful here to dilate upon it. There needs no better ſatisfaction to be had about it, than what the ſlightneſs of the grounds that are alledged for this Authority, compared with the vaſt importance of the thing that they are to prove, does at the firſt ſight offer to any that are impartial. But others have made it their buſineſs, and to <hi>them I remit it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The unwarrantableneſs of this Claim is ſuppoſed in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: And if that be once granted, let the intention of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be never ſo fair in its Exerciſe of this Power, the inſtance above-mentioned will make it ſufficiently clear, how juſt the charge of the <hi>Worſhip of the Image</hi> is due to it: tho it ſhould exerciſe this power over the whole Church of God, within much more moderate bounds than it is known to do. The reality of their intention may without any difficulty be believed; For it was long ſince foretold, that the time would come, that <hi>whoſoever killed</hi> the true Members of Chriſt, <hi>ſhould</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 16. 2, 4.</note> 
                        <hi>think that he did God ſervice in it.</hi> And it is ſaid <hi>to be foretold</hi> on purpoſe, that <hi>when the time ſhould come, we ſhould remember, that it had been told us of them.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> does give the example of it <note place="margin">Acts 22. 3, 4. Acts 26. 9, 10, 11.</note> in himſelf; he verily thought with himſelf, that he <hi>ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did them: For he ſhut up the Saints in Priſon; when they were put to Death, he gave his Voice againſt them:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:204884:160"/> 
                        <hi>He even compelled them to blaſpheme; and was exceeding mad againſt them;</hi> and yet <hi>was zealous towards God,</hi> while he was Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that way unto the death: And yet ſurely none would ever maintain, that the zealous intention of theſe cruel Actions would excuſe them from the guilt of Inhumanity and Murder.</p>
                     <p>The ſincerity of the Intention in all theſe Diabolical acts of Antichriſtian Tyranny, does only denote, how abſolute the power of the Devil is in them, by the power he has over them to make them believe, that it is the doing God ſervice all the while, that they are acted by the Rage of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it may now be ſafely concluded, That the great malignity of the Worſhip of the Beaſt and his Image, does lie in the Acknowledgment of an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Arbitrary Juriſdiction over the Conſciences of all Men,</hi> in the Governing-Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> State and Church.</p>
                     <p>I need add nothing elſe to make the Character of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive enough of all the particulars included in it.</p>
                     <p>For this unbounded Power, eſpecially when ſecured by the Plea of Infallibility, does comprehend in it all the Tyrannical impoſitions that can enſlave the Souls of Men, to give an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and Divine Reverence to the Supreme Power. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded belief of an Infallible Spirit in Men in the exerciſe of their Juriſdiction over the Conſcience, does oblige a Man to a blind Faith in them for every the moſt abſurd and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant thing that they affirm; and to a blind obedience to all their moſt Unreaſonable and Arbitrary Injunctions. It binds him to renounce all uſe of his Underſtanding, that ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to diſcover a falſhood; and to ſtifle all the Light of Conſcience in him, which would make him diſcern betwixt good and evil: And by this means does it not only lay a Man open to the inſpirations and illuſions of the Devil, but to take them alſo for the <hi>Oracles of God;</hi> and makes him uncapable of the Grace of Repentance.</p>
                     <p>This does make it eaſie to underſtand how the Worſhippers of the Beaſt do alſo <hi>Worſhip the Dragon, who gives Power to him.</hi> For this Power being not of God, but of the Dragon, and for his ſervice, as it is expreſly ſaid to be; the Worſhip that is paid to it, is, the Worſhipping of that <note n="e" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ribera</hi> on 16 <hi>B. cap.</hi> 13. moves a Doubt, How Antichriſt, that is to deceive the World with a falſe ſhew, can perſwade them to worſhip the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or Dragon?—And thereupon ſays, The Interpreters do thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:—Men ſhall worſhip Antichriſt: But becauſe he ſhall have his Power from the Devil, by worſhipping of Him, they ſhall worſhip the Devil. So <hi>Aretas, Primatius, Ausbertus, Haymo, Ambroſius Anſelmus.</hi>
                        </note> Dragon, or of the Devil, for whoſe ſervice it is. Beſides, that the Devil or Dragon is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:204884:160"/> repreſented as the conſtant companion of the Beaſt to the laſt, and ſo muſt be the Inſpirer and Manager of the Beaſt in all he does. And then the Devil may be ſaid to be as really in the Throne again, as he was in the Red Dragon; ſo that the Dragon by that, does become the Life and Soul of the Beaſt; and both together make one and the ſame Body of Sovereign Power that is worſhipped.</p>
                     <p>And this does very well expreſs the Tyrannical Perſecutions of the Faithful Members of Chriſt by the <hi>Roman</hi> Powers, which is almoſt the whole Character of the Red Dragon in the <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 3.</note> Chapter before this; and for which he wears thoſe bloody Colours.</p>

The Reſemblance of the Imperial Power in the Church, both as to the Legiſlative, and Executive part of the Government, with the Civil Power in conjunction with the</hi> Roman <hi>Senate.

                     <p>THE Charge of the Idolatrous Worſhip before-mentioned, may ſeem at the very firſt ſight to be juſt enough for the <hi>Worſhip of the Image,</hi> or of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Papal Authority, which is the Head and life of it; But it may not appear to be ſo eaſie to apply the Worſhip of the Beaſt to the <hi>Secular Imperial Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a clear ſatisfaction in this, It will be convenient to take a view of the different ſtates of the Church, <hi>when under Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>when advanced to the Imperial Throne.</hi> It is <hi>very evident,</hi> that the Catholick Church, however united it might be, yet was certainly no Monarchy in the times before <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is the only pretender to the Sovereignty at that time, is ſufficiently known to have had then but a very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Juriſdiction; and nothing did paſs for a Law of the Church, but what was decreed by the Common Aſſembly of the Governours of it.</p>
                     <p>The Church did much reſemble the Union and Government of the States of the United Provinces. The Biſhop and his Clergy were the ſtanding Authority of every particular Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and the People and inferior Clergy were generally the Electors of the Biſhops into their particular places; and the general Aſſembly of them all in Council, was the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church: By them were Laws made, and they were accounted the laſt Appeal for the determination of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Controverſies about Juriſdiction.</p>

                           <q>Then was the Imperial Majeſty firſt brought into the Church, and the Church came to be armed againſt its Enemies with two Swords; <hi>The one the Temporal Sword,</hi> in the hands of Seculars, (or Laics), and of Chriſtian Princes; <hi>the other Spiritual,</hi> in the hands of the Church-Prelates, but <hi>chiefly</hi> that in the Papal Power.</q>

                           <p>In the fifth Action of the Synod at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it is ordered, that a Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Faith be brought in by ſome Biſhops appointed for that purpoſe—And in the ſixth it is ſaid, that after the Emperor <hi>Marcian</hi>'s Speech. the <hi>Emperor's Definition of Faith</hi> was read, which had been mentioned in the fifth Action.</p>
                           <p>The Emperor in the ſame Action confirms the Acts of the Council, and threatens the Contemners of it with condign puniſhment; the ſame does he mention in his Letter to <hi>Palladius.</hi>

                           <p>In the fifth Action the Emperor preſides—orders <hi>Macarius</hi> to bring forth his Teſtimonies—And by the Emperor's Command the Action was finiſhed.</p>
                           <p>In the ſixth the Emperor preſides—is applied to by the Pope's Legats, to deſire that he would command the true Copies of the Book cited by <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> to be ſent for, and the Emperor did accordingly order it to be done the next Seſſion.</p>
                           <p>In the ninth the Emperor preſides, and orders thoſe of the Synod <hi>of one Party</hi> to declare themſelves.</p>
                           <p>The Emperor preſides alſo in the 10th and 11th Actions, and then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Deputies, two Patricians, and two Exconſuls to preſide in his room for the future, becauſe he had heard the Principal things himſelf—They continued till the 18th Action.</p>
                           <p>And in the 18th Action the Emperor preſides, and the Council <hi>firſt</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Acts, and <hi>then</hi> the Emperor.</p>
                           <p>Thereupon does the Emperor <hi>iſſue out</hi> his Edicts to the <hi>People of the Weſt,</hi> to confirm all that had been decreed.</p>
                           <p>The Seventh General Council is ſaid to be called by the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Irene</hi> his Mother in their Letters Patents, and that at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Tharaſius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and the Council it ſelf ſays it was by that pious Decree, <hi>Action.</hi> 7.</p>

So are the Councils of <hi>Arles, Aix, Tours, Chalons, Mentz,</hi> about the ſame time ſaid to be ſummoned by the Command of the Emperor <hi>Charles.</hi> There was alſo a Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> ſaid to be ſummoned by <hi>Charles,</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> as <hi>Gratian</hi> affirms, <hi>D.</hi> 6. <hi>C. Adrianus</hi> 22.</p>
                           <p>And in the Council of <hi>Francford</hi> does <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> give a very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable proof of the Imperial Authority. For by his countenancing it, it condemned the famous Second Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> and with it the Four Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that were held at <hi>Rome</hi> before it, about the ſame buſineſs, in the years 713. 716. 742. 768.</p>
                           <p>And even after the depriving of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Emperor of his Right in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet do the Popes then date their Councils according to the year of the Reign of thoſe Emperors, as it always before had been the Cuſtome; as that of Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Godeſcalcus.—</hi>

                           <p>All the ſeveral Kings in the <hi>Weſt</hi> had alſo the ſame Authority for the ſummoning of Provincial Councils, as may be every-where obſerved in the Tomes of the Councils.</p>
                           <p>The Eighth General Council is ſaid by the Biſhops of it, <hi>Action</hi> 6. That it was ſummoned by the Emperor <hi>(Baſilius)</hi> crowned of God<hi>—And in the 7th Action,</hi> That the Emperor had uſed all diligence to get the Legats of other Patriarchs, as well as thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had thereby aſſembled an Univerſal Council.</p>
                           <p>But Pope <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Baſilius</hi> is the beſt Teſtimony of it—<q>What evil has the <hi>Roman</hi> Church done? Has it not, according to the cuſtom of the former Synods at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſent its Legats at thy Command?</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>And the Emperor himſelf ſays in the Preface to this Council, That the Divine Benignity <hi>having committed the Helm of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Ship</hi> to his care, he had taken care before all things to appeaſe the Eccleſiaſtical Storms.</p>
                           <p>The Popes Legats did indeed preſide in this Council. But it is the firſt, where-ever they can be found to have done ſo.</p>

                              <q>After the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Catholick Faith by the Holy Synod, we have thought it juſt and expedient to take away all diſpute and contention about it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                     <p>But that which does the moſt fully ſhew, what ſhare the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors had in the Government of the Church, and in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Councils, is the 45th of <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Novels, where all the Canons of Councils are turned into Laws of the Empire. Indeed the general definition of the Law in the <hi>Code,</hi> together
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:204884:162"/> with the explication of it there, does expreſly determine the <hi>will of the Emperor</hi> to be the only rule and meaſure of Law either in Church or State.</p>
                     <p>The general definition of a Law, is in theſe terms. <hi>Whatever</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>The Synodical Epiſtle of that Council ſays the ſame. So alſo <hi>Balſamon</hi> in his Preface to that Council. And <hi>Socrat. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</p>
                        </note> before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's command for it.</p>
                     <p>We do accordingly ſee what effect the fear of the Imperial Authority had upon the Councils themſelves. For all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils aſſembled under <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperors, were of the ſame mind with the Emperor that called them; And if ſome ſhould think, that it was rather the judgment of their own Conſciences, they muſt then allow, that the generality of the Governours of the Church were really <hi>Arrians,</hi> and ſincerely Orthodox, within the ſpace of leſs than thirty years. It is certain that the <hi>Arrian</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Ariminum</hi> was more than twice as numerous as the biggeſt General Councils beſides; The Councils <hi>indeed</hi> were of the ſame mind with the Emperor that called them; And it is well worth the obſerving, how the Biſhops of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> divided at the <hi>Sardican</hi> Council about the buſineſs of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> according to the different minds <note n="h" place="margin">See Note <hi rend="sup">c</hi>, and <hi rend="sup">f</hi>, of this Chapter, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> Univerſal Biſhop.</note> of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Conſtans,</hi> who ſent them thither.</p>
                     <p>By this then it appears, that the Imperial Authority did from its firſt owning of the Chriſtian Religion, look ſo big in the Church, that thoſe of the higheſt Character in it, did <hi>bow down</hi> to its will and pleaſure. And when withal it is conſidered, that all the Parts of the Catholick Church were under this <hi>Roman</hi> Government, it is plain, That the proper appellative of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church at that time, was the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, becauſe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> were of the ſame import, when all the World was <hi>Roman;</hi> And <hi>the Principle of Political <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> amongſt them all, which made them one Body, and one Church in the face of the World, was their owning the <hi>Roman Emperor;</hi> with his <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Senate</hi> (or General Council) for their Supream Ruler and Governour.</p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:204884:163"/>
                     <p> It appears then, that the Imperial Power was the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at that time in the Church upon Earth. General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were but his Senate; And whether they were in the right or the wrong, it was his conſent that gave them their <note n="i" place="margin">

                           <p>Becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſuffers great Violences at the Death of the Pope, when the Election is made without the Emperor's knowledge; We ordain, That when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be choſen, that he be elected in a full Aſſembly of the Biſhops and Clergy, and in the preſence of the Senate and People; and ſo being choſen in the preſence of the Legate of the Emperor, that he be conſecrated.</p>

                        </note> Biſhoprick of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> was in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account for Supremacy, than the reſt of the Epiſcopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, and all of them were confined to their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Territories.</p>
                     <p>But it was reputed juſt and fitting at the coming in of the Emperors into the Church, that the Biſhop of their Ruling City ſhould have a mark of diſtinction from the reſt, as an honour due to the Emperor's Court, and Reſidence; And thus came the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to have the precedence of all other Biſhops in the Church; And upon the ſame account had <hi>Conſtanſtinople</hi> the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:204884:163"/> ſecond place to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> when that City became the Seat of a new Empire.</p>
                     <p>This Primacy gave the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> a great advantage over the Intereſts of their Fellow-Biſhops; And being become very neceſſary to the Emperors for upholding their Power in the midſt of the Invaſions of the Barbarous Nations, the Emperors were willing to enlarge their Authority, to make uſe of it for the management of their own Affairs; And after that the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were ſetled in ſo many Sovereign Princes, that Church-Authority, which they themſelves had now loſt in thoſe ſeveral Kingdoms, they were not unwilling to beſtow upon the Chief Biſhop of their City; and ſo by ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances he came at laſt to get the Title of <hi>Occumenical Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Head</hi> of the Church of Chriſt upon Earth.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſtill did the Emperors retain their Power of the ſetting up of every new Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> The Emperors <note n="m" place="margin">
                           <hi>This is thus well expreſſed by</hi> John Wex <hi>de Antichriſto, p.</hi> 119. <q>And ſo the Ten Kings delivered to the Beaſt their Kingdoms which they had got at the diſſolution of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, according to <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. 12. For after that the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire was broken in pieces, all the Kingdoms of the <hi>Weſt</hi> did join again together in one body, that by the bonds and tye of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Superſtition of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> they might fight againſt the Lamb.</q>
                        </note> Conſent was ſtill held neceſſary for the confirmation of the Election, as the Chief Power upon Earth, that gave him his Authority; And upon this account he was ſet up <hi>as the Emperor's Deputy and Creature,</hi> to be the Univerſal Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in all the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Kingdoms of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which now would own no other <hi>Secular</hi> Head of the Churches in them, but thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns which ruled them; And thus came the divided <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to be <hi rend="sup">n</hi> 
                        <hi>one entire thing again,</hi> and the ſeveral Kings in it to own <hi>one Roman Head</hi> again ſet up by the Imperial Authority.</p>
                     <p>Things continued not long in this <hi>mere ſpiritual</hi> and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical State. The new Eccleſiaſtical Head uſed all ways to make himſelf univerſally acknowledged for ſuch: And to that end, as Head of the Church, he aſſumes a power of executing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Councils upon Sovereign Princes, to the depriving them of their Kingdoms, if they refuſed to execute the Orders of the Church upon all thoſe that were diſobedient to it, and that even to the puniſhment of death.</p>
                     <p>From hence then we have a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>the worſhip of the Beaſt, and of his Image,</hi> from the firſt Riſe of the laſt Ruling Head, or of the Imperial Power reſtored by <hi>Juſtinian.</hi>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:204884:170"/> this place, <hi>That it was a common faſhion in St.</hi> John<hi>'s time</hi> for every Heathen God to have a particular Society, or Fraternity belonging to him; and the way of admitting any into theſe fraternities was, 1. By giving them ſome Hieroglyphick <hi>mark</hi> in their <hi>Hands,</hi> or <hi>Forehead,</hi> which was accounted Sacred to that particular God; as that of an <hi>Ivy-leaf</hi> to own themſelves of the fraternity of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> 2. By Sealing them with <hi>the Letters of the name</hi> of that God. And, 3. with that <hi>number,</hi> which the <hi>Greek</hi> Letters of their name did make up; for the Numeral Cyphers of the <hi>Greeks</hi> were the Letters of the Alphabet. Thus the <hi>Greek</hi> Letters of the Name of the <hi>Sun,</hi> did in all make up 608. And therefore his fraternity were marked with XH.</p>
                     <p>A very great confirmation of this way of interpreting <hi>the Name,</hi> and <hi>Number of the Name,</hi> is <hi>Irenaeus</hi>'s Teſtimony from <note place="margin">

                        <q>That the Number of the Name of the Beaſt is the number ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> Letters, of which the Name of the Beaſt is made up, according to the uſual computation of the <hi>Greeks</hi> by the Letters of their Alphabet; and which in the preſent inſtance muſt in all make up the number of 666.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This indeed is not to be meant of the Sealing of any ſuch Marks upon the fleſh of the followers of the Beaſt in a <hi>literal ſenſe;</hi> yet by Analogy it muſt be underſtood of ſome particular marks of diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and others; and then what does more fitly ſuit with this, than the <hi>Greek</hi> name of <hi>Latinos,</hi> which does exactly fill up the number of 666, or the number of the Beaſt? What was more likely to be deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it in the Text, than this, ſince this was the known di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing name of the Weſtern <hi>Romans</hi> from thoſe of the Eaſt, after the diviſion of the Empire? And in the whole Body of theſe Viſions about the Beaſt, I make no queſtion but all the Characters are <hi>ſuch, as all the World might eaſily know them,</hi> when they came to be fulfilled. Now it is evident, That in all the ſolemn Acts of the Empire, and in <hi>General Councils,</hi> This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction was always obſerved betwixt thoſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church; and that name of the <hi>Latins</hi> had the Weſtern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Princes and Potentates; eſpecially amongſt that people in whoſe Language the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> was writ, That is, <hi>The Greeks.</hi>

This Truth is ſo clear to me, that I cannot ſufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire thoſe, who fancy, That this Number 666 was here given to ſignifie a name, that was before unknown to the Church; and he quotes <hi>Arethus</hi> upon this place to the ſame purpoſe,—That thereby was ſignified, that the great things there mentioned about the Beaſt, did not relate to things whoſe Names were unknown; but to a Name then very well known.</q>
                        </note> That the name of <hi>Latins</hi> was ſo well known to ſignify the <hi>Romans</hi> about the time of the Viſion, That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> does pitch upon this, as one of the moſt likely names that did anſwer the number of the <note place="margin">L. 5. c. 24. <hi>Contra Haeres.</hi>

                     <p>So that he takes a <hi>Latin</hi> and a <hi>Roman</hi> for the ſame thing in his time. Wherefore to have the <hi>mark, name,</hi> and <hi>number of the name</hi> of the Beaſt, may very well ſignify the having and owning the name of a <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> as that is the ſame thing with the name of a <hi>Latin,</hi> and is a word of diſtinction betwixt a Member of the <hi>Roman,</hi> and of any other communion of Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>It is very remarkable to this purpoſe, according, as has been by others obſerved, that this does very happily anſwer the fondneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for the <hi>Latin Tongue,</hi> as that which they would have generally known to be the peculiar Language of their Church in diſtinction to both the common Language of the World about any other Affairs, and to the Language of any other Churches.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is decreed, That notwithſtanding the very change of the Language of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, none of the publick Offices of the Church ſhall be in any other Language than <hi>Latin;</hi> And that the Word of God it ſelf ſhall be conveyed to the people in no other Language, nor any other Tranſlation allowed to be Authentick, but that of the <hi>Vulgar Latine;</hi> ſo that they will not allow <hi>either</hi> God to ſpeak to his people, <hi>or</hi> his people to ſpeak to him, but in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue; and by this do they diſtinguiſh themſelves, as the publick <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> by which they are known all the World over. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> gives an inſtance in his cenſure of <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s Tranſlation of <hi>Origen</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> How naturally any one would judge the Language of <hi>Babylon</hi> to be the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, <hi>Apolog. adverſ.

                     <p>There cannot ſurely be found a more remarkable badge, or token, to be publickly and univerſally known by, than this <hi>mark in the mouth</hi> of the Beaſt, compared with the name of a <hi>Roman,</hi> that every one that enters himſelf into their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion muſt liſt himſelf under.

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE particular inſtances explained in the former Chapter, do clearly ſhow, that the exerciſe of the Power of the falſe Prophet, does in all the parts of it regard the Beaſt, as the principal concern of his deſign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Worſhip,</hi> that he promotes, is the <hi>Worſhip of the Beaſt. The Image</hi> that he cauſes to be made, is an Image made in honour of the Beaſt it ſelf: And the <hi>Worſhip</hi> that is given to it, is becauſe of its being the Image of that Beaſt <hi>that was deadly wounded, and was healed again.</hi> And the <hi>mark, name,</hi> and <hi>number of the name,</hi> is the name of the Beaſt, by which all Men were to own themſelves the peculiar ſlaves of the Beaſt: And this is no more than what the Character of that Power, which the falſe Prophet did exerciſe in all theſe ways, does plainly intimate to us; for it is ſaid to be the Power of the Beaſt it ſelf, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed hefore him:</hi> And therefore muſt the exerciſe of it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his account; and thoſe that were employed in it, were therefore but his Miniſters, and Inſtruments in it.</p>
                     <p>All which does ſignifie to us, That the <hi>Supremacy of the Pope, the Infallibility of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>the blind Submiſſion</hi> and Veneration that is paid to it, <hi>the taking the name of a</hi> Roman Catholick, <hi>the confining of all the publick Offices</hi> of Religion and Devotion to God, and of the lively Oracles of God, to the old <hi>Roman</hi> Language: That all theſe things are done in honour of the Univerſal Imperial Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that in the time of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Authority over <hi>Rome</hi> reſtored by <hi>Juſtinian:</hi> And therefore are all theſe things ſignified to be the Worſhip of the Beaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the laſt Ruling Head; becauſe it is <hi>not a Civil</hi> honour that is given to this Empire, and the Head of it; But the giving
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:204884:178"/> them the <hi>Prerogative of Almighty God,</hi> the Power of ſetting up a Spiritual Authority, which ſhall give Law to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Men, according to their own will and pleaſure, and ſhall have the Spirit of God confined to their Arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and the Curſes of God to diſpoſe of at their will, againſt all that diſſent from them.</p>
                     <p>The Beaſt therefore is the final Object of all the Worſhip <note place="margin">N. B.</note> and Honour that is given: and therefore does generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in it all the under-Actors and Inſtruments in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, where he is mentioned alone.</p>
                     <p>Thus ln the <hi>17th.</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the falſe Prophet,</hi> or <hi>of the Image,</hi> but only of the Beaſt, and of the magnificent appearance of his Empire under the name of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And therefore <hi>by the Beaſt</hi> muſt there be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all his Miniſters and Inſtruments joyned with him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the ſeveral Characters that he is joyned with.</p>
                     <p>As in the time of the <hi>Mayres</hi> of the Palace in <hi>France, by the name of the King,</hi> muſt many times be underſtood the will of thoſe <hi>Mayres</hi> to the prejudice of the Royal Authority, becauſe it was the King's Power that was exerciſed by them: And all the Honour and Obedience that they had, was upon the account of their being authorized by him. So alſo do the Actions and Honour of the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and <hi>the Image,</hi> go under <hi>the name</hi> of the Beaſt in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> tho in reality they have been much to the diminution of the Imperial Authority.</p>
                     <p>It is enough to qualifie them, to be comprehended under the name of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> that they concur with the Beaſt in his great deſign of making all the World to ſubmit to an Eccleſiaſtical Authority of his own Creating, as the acknowledgment of the Honour of his Empire. For all the Worſhip that is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promoted, is, The Honour ſhown to the Imperial Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is ſubmitted to as the only ground for any hopes of Salvation: And that not upon the account of its being the <hi>Catholick Church of Chriſt,</hi> but for that which is at preſent a contradiction to it, <hi>viz.</hi> for being the <hi>Roman-Catholick Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, when the ten Kings are ſaid <hi>to give their Power,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>and Strength, and Kingdoms to the Beaſt,</hi> it is to be underſtood of their concurrence to advance the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, as the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:204884:179"/> Religion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was firſt ſet up, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the Imperial Authority, and ſo ſtill continues to be defended, and protected by it; and therein does the Worſhip of the Beaſt more eminently appear, becauſe of the ſubmiſſion of crowned Heads to it, who have no Superior upon Earth, but God alone. For it is very difficult to underſtand how ten Kings can be ſuppoſed to be <hi>of one mind,</hi> and <hi>to agree to give their Kingdoms</hi> to the Worſhip of any Power upon Earth, but only in this way of an Uniformity in a common Religion, which is ſet up by the Will, and to the Honour of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>And here it is to be obſerved, how exactly the Prophecy, and the Event, do agree with one another in reſpect of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is obſerved in the Text. The Beaſt is deſcribed <hi>as beginning</hi> the Scene firſt, and ſetting the deſign on foot: And the falſe prophet and the Image come in afterwards to <hi>perfect</hi> and accompliſh it; which was very punctually verified by the beginning of the Univerſal Monarchy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Imperial Authority, and the advancement of it into a perfect Tyranny by the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy. So that after a while, the Falſe-prophet ſeems to take the power of the Beaſt out of his hands, and to exerciſe it before his face; and then the Beaſt had little to do himſelf in the management of it, and ſeemed only to give Authority to what was done by others; which is alſo now manifeſt from the common courſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church in their proceedings againſt Hereticks. They judge, condemn, and pronounce ſentence againſt them, and <hi>then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> them over to the Secular power, who are <hi>the executioners of</hi> the Sentence. All that the Civil power does in it, is but to follow the commands of the Church, and to ſtrike the laſt ſtroke only, which is all that can make them be ſaid to <hi>have an hand</hi> in it.</p>
                     <p>And thô it muſt be confeſſed, that the Secular part in it, is that which does the moſt effectually perſuade to the worſhip of the Beaſt; yet it is plain, That the Church is the <hi>principal Agent</hi> in that alſo; becauſe they overawe the Civil Power into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances with them, which does very naturally anſwer the power of the Image in the Prophecy, <hi>to cauſe</hi> all thoſe who would not worſhip it, to be killed.</p>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:204884:179"/>
                     <p> The Falſe-prophet is the Head of this Image, and ſo is the chief manager of this Church-Tyranny; and therefore is it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſaid of him, That <hi>he ſpake like a Dragon,</hi> or like that Red Dragon in the 12th Chapter juſt before, and found to be the Devil raging againſt the followers of the Lamb.</p>

                        <hi>a Ravenous wolf?</hi> How could this have been more clearly expreſſed in a Prophecy, where <hi>the Lamb</hi> and <hi>the Dragon</hi> are in a very peculiar manner, and very commonly reſtrained to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>the Devil?</hi> And what could more openly ſhow us the difference betwixt <hi>the Dragon</hi> in the 12th Chapter, and <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in the 13th. thô both enemies to the Chriſtian Church in the ſame Seven Headed, Ten Horned Empire, or better ſatisfy us why there needed two different figures of Dragon and Beaſt, to ſignify thoſe two kind of Hoſtilities againſt the Church of Chriſt?</p>

                     <p>And the enforcing of falſe-worſhip by all the Arts of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, under the pretence of the Authority of Chriſt, does therefore fill up the whole Character that is given, of his having the Horns of a Lamb, and ſpeaking like the Red Dragon; for nothing does more reſemble the nature of the Devil, than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Tyranny under the Mask of Piety.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> where we may obſerve a plain diſtinction made betwixt <hi>the Seed of the Woman:</hi> The <hi>Warr,</hi> that the Dragon makes, is with that part of her Seed, <hi>which keep the Commandments of God,</hi> and <hi>have the Teſtimony,</hi> or are the Witneſſes or Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt; which intimates, that the <hi>Reſt of her Seed</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Commandments of God, and from the truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>By this we have a new ſcene opened about the enmity of the Dragon againſt the Church; The Time of it is after the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Diviſions of the Empire in thoſe Kings of the Barbarians, ſignified by the <hi>ſwallowing up of the great flood by the earth,</hi> That is, after the riſe of the Ten Kings in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and the party againſt whom this War is carried on,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:204884:181"/> are the Godly Seed of the Woman; not againſt all her Seed, but againſt thoſe <hi>only, who keep God's Commandments,</hi> and are the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> or the Martyrs <hi>of Jeſus,</hi> or as they are elſewhere called, <hi>The Witneſſes in Sackcloth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How this was brought to paſs, That which does immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow this deſign of the Dragon, does inform us: For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon it, appears <hi>a Beaſt</hi> with all the ſame Emblems of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that the Dragon had; and to him the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon <note place="margin">Rev. 13. 1.</note> is ſaid <hi>to give his Power, and his Seat,</hi> and <hi>great Authority;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 2.</note> And thus does the Dragon fulfill the intention that he had juſt before, to War with the choſen Remnant of the Womans Seed: He does not appear himſelf in it, but inſpires another ſet up in his place to do it. By which it is evidently ſignified, That this new war with the dutiful part of the Womans Seed, is not managed by any <hi>Roman</hi> Power, which is openly known to be the profeſſed Enemy of God, and of the Chriſtian Religion, as that Government of the Empire was, which had the open ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Devil's management in it; And if it were not <hi>ſuch a Power</hi> that ſhould appear like an open profeſſed Enemy of the Chriſtian Religion, it muſt be <hi>ſuch</hi> as muſt profeſs that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and out of a pretended zeal to it, exerciſe all the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Devil, or Dragon, againſt the true profeſſors of it. For all the great buſineſs of the Beaſt, is Religious worſhip; and if that Religion be not profeſſed enmity to the Chriſtian (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that would make it the open ſhow of the Dragon, as it was before his fall) It muſt then be a zealous outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Chriſtian Religion, to perſecute and to deſtroy the true maintainers of it.</p>
                     <p>This does determine the time of the firſt ſettlement of the Woman in the Wilderneſs, for the ſpace of a Time, Times and an half. For thô it be ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 6. That She fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs; yet it is not there ſaid, that ſhe was ſetled there; but only, that ſhe <hi>had a place prepared</hi> for her there, to be <hi>fed for One Thouſand two Hundred and Sixty days.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, after many great Actions intervening, ſhe is ſaid at the 14th Verſe to be but then in a condition to fly into the Wilderneſs; and after ſhe was flying thither, the Dragon caſt out a flood after her, and hindred her ſettlement there, till that was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up; and therefore did her Time, Times, and Half-time, begin but juſt at the ſame time with the Dragon's perſecuting
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:204884:182"/> 
                        <hi>the remnant of her Seed,</hi> which was juſt at the firſt riſe of the Beaſt, and ſo confirms the Synchroniſm of the Woman and the Beaſt for their whole time.</p>
                     <p>We are therefore now to enquire from the Hiſtory of the Chriſtian Church, how it can be ſaid, that <hi>from the time of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian,</hi> all the true Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Faith, were <hi>forced</hi> by Tyrannical uſage to worſhip the Will of the Chriſtian <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors about matters of Religion, thereby to fit the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters here given to the Beaſt, <hi>to the Imperial Head reſtored in the Weſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus we find, that at the Time that the Chriſtian Church (The Woman) was ſecured in the Two Imperial Seats of the Eaſt and Weſt (the two Wings of a great Eagle) from all the inundations of Pagan people (or from the face of the Serpent) The Devil did then ſet up perſecution in the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne, againſt the true and faithful Members of the Chriſtian Church, (The Remnant of the Seed of the Woman, which keep the Commandments of God) while ſhe her ſelf was in the Wilderneſs, or in a place of ſecurity.</p>

                           <hi>The particular point of the firſt date of the Riſe of the Beaſt, enquired after in order. The firſt conception and progreſs of the chief Malignity of the Beaſt. It entred with</hi> Theodoſius, <hi>and was ſetled by</hi> Juſtinian: <hi>And appears to have been the enforcing of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity by Penalties able to make the generality of the World to comply againſt their Conſciences.</hi> Juſtinian<hi>'s peculiar Talent in the ſetling this Method for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>FRom the former Account of the over-ruling Authority of the Chriſtian Emperors in all Church-Affairs, and of the great veneration which they had for the Councils aſſembled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, it is obvious for any one to conclude, That they lay very open to the danger of requiring <hi>Divine Honours</hi> to be given them. For this muſt needs make them very apt to command many things (which God has left free and undetermined) to be received for Points of Faith neceſſary to Salvation, as <hi>inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt</hi> in Council. And it is evident, that in ſuch a caſe, the will of him that enjoins ſuch things, is taken for the Will of God; and ſo he may very well be ſaid to require the Honour of God to be given to his own will.</p>
                     <p>One cannot but think it very probable upon this account, that ſuch a kind of Worſhip, as is called the <hi>Worſhip of the Beaſt,</hi> was ſometimes enjoined before the Riſe of the Beaſt, ſince there were many <hi>Erroneous</hi> Councils before that time; And, <hi>it may be,</hi> many things in <hi>Orthodox</hi> Councils made to be Inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt, and preſſed upon the Conſciences of men, <hi>as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles,</hi> neceſſarily to be obeyed, which were but the mere Arbitrary Injunctions of men.</p>
                     <p>But yet, though the ſame kind of Worſhip might have been commanded before his appearance, yet it could not be the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Beaſt,</hi> till it was the owning of the <hi>Roman Authority</hi> for the Will of God <hi>in thoſe particular Circumſtances</hi> of Antichriſtian
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:204884:184"/> Idolatry, and Tyranny, in which it is deſcribed to be all over the Prophecy; And this it came not to be, till it was the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the laſt Ruling Head, in the midſt of the ſeveral divided Kingdoms of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, according to the deſcription of it in the ſhow of the Figure: <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
                     <p>And beſides, there is one <hi>peculiar circumſtance</hi> in the worſhip of the Beaſt, which was never fulfilled till the time of his Reign; and that is, an <hi>actual conformity of all the whole world</hi> to it. How peremptory ſoever the command for that Worſhip might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet it will appear, that it could not long obtain amongſt all thoſe that were of a contrary judgment, <hi>before the ſetled eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment</hi> of it at the new return of the Imperial Government in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon that I give for this, is, becauſe the Laws and Commands of the Emperors for Uniformity, <hi>either</hi> had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time any penalties in them ſufficient to make <hi>all the world</hi> to comply with them, <hi>or</hi> were hindred from any <hi>ſetled</hi> continued <hi>execution</hi> of them. The Penalties annexed to their Laws for Conformity, were generally either nothing but <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's,</hi> which Diſſenters would not value, <hi>or</hi> deprivations of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men, and Military men; And the pulling down, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcating the publick Meeting-place, <hi>or</hi> prohibitions to <hi>all</hi> men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt coming into the Imperial City: And there was no force in theſe Penalties for an Univerſal Conformity; And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire would not allow the other ſevere and more general Penalties to have any conſtant effect.</p>
                     <p>We ſee <hi>Honorius</hi> ſoon after, alledging this reaſon for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his Commands for the terrifying of Hereticks, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was then delivered from the fear of <hi>Attalus</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and <hi>Alaricus</hi> the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> King. Now, ſays he, that <hi>the Oracle</hi> is taken away, by whom they were encouraged to the exerciſe of their Heretical Superſtition, Let all the Enemies of the Holy Law know, that they ſhall be puniſhed with Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo to blood, if they will dare to meet ſtill in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. <hi>Hieron.

                     <p>Wherefore it can never be thought that there was any thing of this General Conformity in the 4th, or 5th Centuries, <hi>either</hi> in the Reign of the Orthodox, or <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperors. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſeems to have gone as high in his Commands as moſt that came after him, till the time of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> We have <note n="a" place="margin">SEE Note the 8th. on the 2d Chapter, <hi>Socrates,</hi> l. 1. c. 6.</note> in his Edicts,

For the Imperial Authority was now confined to a very ſmall Juriſdiction, and the reſt of the Empire was divided into ſeveral Kingdoms, which had no other <hi>Secular</hi> Sovereign to command them, but their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Kings. There was therefore no other way of reducing them all to one Religion, but by the advancement of a <hi>Spiritual Roman</hi> Authority to be <hi>the principle of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> amongſt them, whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs it ſhould be to overawe the Conſcience with the Curſes
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:204884:185"/> of the Church, for the enforcing the execution of the Imperial Penalties.</p>
                     <p>For as the Imperial Laws were <hi>for every thing elſe</hi> the ſtanding Laws of theſe divided Kingdoms, ſo the only way to make their Edicts and Sanctions of Councils <hi>about Church-matters</hi> to take place amongſt them, was to have them confirmed and enforced by the Authority of an Univerſal Head of the Church. And though the Church Head ſeems by this to be <hi>the principal</hi> in all this Affair, yet the Temporal Penalties of the Laws, being <hi>the only certain</hi> means to effect an Univerſal Conformity, and this Sovereign Head of the Church himſelf being alſo a Creature of the Imperial Power to carry on his deſign of Uniformity in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, as has been obſerved; all the Obedience that <note place="margin">Chap. 22.</note> is given by other Princes, and their Subjects, is really nothing but the Worſhip of the Beaſt, or of the Imperial Religion; and they <hi>give their Kingdoms to the Beaſt,</hi> when they force their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to ſubmit to that <hi>Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was nothing that could make it look more like the worſhipping of that <hi>Roman</hi> Authority, than this Submiſſion of the Ten Kings, who were abſolute in their Kingdoms, and had as much right to appoint the Laws of Religion to their Subjects, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor had in his own Territories; But by this conformity to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they did ſeem to lay down their <note place="margin">N. B.</note> Crowns at the feet of that Nation, and to adore them, as the great <hi>Dictators</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> of the Will of God.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed not the leaſt appearance of ſo general an Uniformity at the end of the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Juſtin,</hi> who, as has been obſerved, was not able ſo much as to bring it about within the bounds of his own Territories.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> immediately after him, appears in this Deſign like a new Blazing-ſtar in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> whom all the World began to be afraid of.

                           <p>Therefore is <hi>Juſtinian</hi> choſen out by the people of <hi>Rome</hi> in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection againſt Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> as the example of the greateſt <hi>Roman</hi> Prince for the Emperour <hi>Conrad</hi> to reſemble; in favour of whom they declared in theſe Verſes,</p>

And here does his Faith appear to be made the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>meaſure of Orthodoxy</hi> to the whole Empire upon a Penalty which had terror enough in it.</p>
                     <p>This Faith he ſends to Pope <hi>John</hi> for his concurrence with him in it; And tells him, <hi>that he did it to conform all to the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>that it was always his deſire to preſerve the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick See,</hi> and the ſtate of the Holy Churches of God; And for that purpoſe <hi>to bring all the Eaſtern Churches under his ſubjection,</hi> and <hi>to unite them to the See of his Holineſs.</hi>

                     <p> Though the Emperor's Faith ſhould be accounted Orthodox, yet the inducing ſuch a new Penalty, which ſhould force it upon the Conſciences of all men, as ſo neceſſary to ſalvation, that a man could not poſſibly be a Member of the Catholick Church without the profeſſion of it, was certainly unwarrantable, and <hi>the firſt beginning of that Tyrannizing Power</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which made the whole World to conform to all its Arbitrary Decrees, and to worſhip it with a blind obedience to all its moſt unreaſonable Commands.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>moſt publick Inſtances</hi> of the effects of the Emperor's zeal for Uniformity, are the Synods that were called by him.

                     <p>But this was nothing to his Behaviour in the Controverſie about the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> and in <hi>the fifth General Council,</hi> as it is called, which being after his Conqueſts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> found his Spirit in a right diſpoſition to affect to exalt the Imperial Authority in the Church.</p>
                     <p>He firſt publiſhes a Book about thoſe things, and paſſes a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <note place="margin">Petav. <hi>Ration. Temp. ibidem.</hi>
                        </note> upon <hi>the three Chapters</hi> againſt the will and ſollicitations of his Clergy; then <hi>forces Mennas,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with the reſt of the Patriarchs, to ſubſcribe to it; ſends for <hi>Pope Vigilius,</hi> and after much reluctance he at laſt gets him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The next year <hi>Vigilius</hi> publiſhes a Decree, in which, <hi>with a Salvo</hi> to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> he does expreſly condemn <hi>the three Chapters. Juſtinian</hi> not content with this, uſes all means with <hi>Vigilius,</hi> by threats and contumelies, to condemn them <hi>abſolutely</hi> without any mention of the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> but being not able to break him to it, to ſhew him that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſet up for nothing but to be the Emperor's Property, and to promote a general Conformity to the Imperial Religion; <hi>Againſt the Pope's will</hi> he calls a General Council at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for this end; which had <hi>always</hi> been the method of the former
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:204884:187"/> Emperors <hi>to unite</hi> the Differences about Religion, and to make the whole Church conformable to their minds.</p>
                     <p>The Pope in the mean while declares againſt this Aſſembly, <hi>not</hi> upon the account of any claim of a Superior Authority in himſelf above that of the Emperor; <hi>but becauſe</hi> he judged the Emperor's mind to be contrary to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> And it was accounted a kind of Sacrilege to revoke any thing that was decreed in Council.</p>
                     <p>But neither could the Authority of the Pope, nor of the reſt of the Clergy, hinder the Council from doing, <hi>as Councils uſed to do,</hi> that is, from being of the ſame mind with their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; And ſo, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> would have it, they condemned the <hi>three Chapters,</hi> and pronounced an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all thoſe who ſhould defend them, or any part of them, by the Authority of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> Whereas it is manifeſt, that in that Council, the chief of theſe things were particularly examined, and <hi>Ibas,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> the Authors of theſe Writings, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Synod as Orthodox, and the <note n="r" place="margin">

                           </p>
                           <p>And this Approbation of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> is quoted by Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi> againſt <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in his Conſtitution—And <hi>decrees the contrary to him, with this preamble,—</hi>We, <hi>following the judgment of the Holy Fathers—And afterwards—</hi>Theſe things therefore we having ordered with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diligence.</p>
                        </note> Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas</hi> in particular, declared to contain in it no heretical Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Here was as great an inſtance of Imperial Authority over a Council, as could well be given, to make them define his Will to be <hi>an Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, contrary to matter of fact.</hi> And the Pope, and his own Clergy, were ſufficient Witneſſes of it to the World, by refuſing to ſubſcribe to that falſhood about a thing, which their Eyes might be the Judges of in the Acts of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In that Synod does <hi>Juſtinian</hi> alſo Authorize a new way of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's</hi> in the Church; and that was <hi>to curſe the dead,</hi> whom he judged not to have been right in the Faith, which was a practiſe never before heard of; And therein among the reſt he curſes <hi>Origen,</hi> who in his time was accounted one of the <hi>moſt eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the Church <hi>for ſanctity of life, for profound Learning,</hi> and his <hi>great Services</hi> to the Church. So that if it has pleaſed God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and ſome of the reſt, their Speculative Errors, they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may be thoſe <hi>Saints in Heaven, againſt which the Beaſt is ſaid to open his mouth in blaſphemy,</hi> Rev. 13. 6.</p>
                     <p>But beſides this, he brings in faſhion another way of curſing in the Council, which all the Rational World cannot but look upon as very ſtrangely extravagant; and that was <hi>to anathematize all ſuch, who did not damn all thoſe whom they called Hereticks:</hi> Which
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:204884:187"/> certainly was one of the higheſt Acts of Tyranny over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Univerſal Church, and which of all their Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions was the moſt difficult to ſubſcribe unto. For whatſoever accommodating Interpretations men may find out to ſubſcribe to a form of Faith, which they do not believe in the common ſenſe of the words, yet they can never juſtify themſelves in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Curſes of God <hi>upon all thoſe</hi> who do not ſubſcribe to it. And yet both this and the former way of Curſing was from that time continued in the Church.</p>
                     <p>Never was there before, ſuch an appearance <hi>all at one time</hi> of a new aſſuming Power over the Church of God, as in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of all that buſineſs of the three Chapters; inſomuch that it was generally enough taken notice of to make <hi>the worſhip of the Beaſt</hi> appear a very ſtrange, and new thing, and to make <hi>the World wonder after the Beaſt,</hi> as it is ſaid of him. The Books of <hi>Facundus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hermiana,</hi> againſt that Emperor, for theſe Arbitrary Proceedings, are a ſufficient Teſtimony, what noiſe theſe things did at that time make in the World; and nothing could have made them to be ſo ſlightly paſſed over in Hiſtory, but the greater Extravagancies of the Popiſh Councils that came afterwards.</p>
                     <p>That Biſhop tells him, <note n="s" place="margin">

                        <q>That it was not lawful for the Emperor to intermeddle in this manner in the Office of the Prieſt: ſhows him the Example of <hi>

                        <q>As if, ſays he, <hi>the Faith of all the Churches</hi> did depend upon the Emperor's Will, and as if <hi>none</hi> muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwiſe <hi>than the Emperor ſhould command</hi> him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</q>

                     <p>However, we find <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſtill keeping his point againſt them all; he defends this curſing of the Dead in a publick Edict of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:204884:188"/> the Confeſſion of his Faith, and turns the Council into a Law of the Empire, <hi>Novell.</hi> 42. The Pope all this while, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is pretended to be ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the making of a Council, declared himſelf <hi>contrary</hi> to all this, was baniſhed <note place="margin">Petav. <hi>Ration. Temp. part.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> for it, and ſo ill handled in it, that it was at laſt the cauſe of his Death. So that here was a very clear appearance of the Imperial <hi>Roman</hi> Authority in the Church, which appears to be <hi>the only ſoul and head</hi> of this, which is called the fifth General Council. For it could not have its name of a Council of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church from any at that time, but the Biſhops there aſſembled, and the Imperial Authority, which confirmed it.</p>
                     <p>To pretend that it was afterwards confirmed by another Pope, and ſo made a Council, is to give the Pope a power to change the nature of things; For if it wanted its due Authority at that time, it muſt be <hi>no</hi> Council <hi>at all;</hi> and the Pope may as well be allowed to turn all the Religious Meetings of Biſhops, that ever were, into Councils at his pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>There was then nothing here, but <hi>the worſhip of the Beaſt</hi> alone, without the Falſe Prophet to aſſiſt him. But that all the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of theſe Procedures are chargeable upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church as the beginning of the Tyrannical Exerciſe of their Power, is manifeſt enough <hi>from tbe confirmation</hi> of this Fifth Council, by almoſt all the <hi>Roman</hi> Councils after.</p>
                     <p>And now came thoſe Laws about Hereticks and Apoſtates, in faſhion, which were always found to do the greateſt ſervice <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; and thoſe were ſuch as had a ſufficient Penalty in them to oblige all to obey them; ſuch as theſe, <note n="t" place="margin">

                     <p>But beſides the Characters of the Malignity of the Beaſt which are generally ſumm'd up in the Worſhip of him, there is alſo a particular deſcription in the 17th Chapter of the <hi>Idolatrous ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church under the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Great Whore,</hi> which is a known term amongſt the Prophets to expreſs the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of a Nation, which had been the True Church of God.</p>
                     <p>And this charge of Idolatry is brought againſt the Church by the Prophets, <hi>not only</hi> when they worſhipped ſtrange Gods, <hi>but alſo</hi> when they worſhipped the True God by corporeal Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations; as it has been ſufficiently made out of late by the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:204884:193"/> diſputes about <hi>Aaron</hi>'s and <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calves; and may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhown from that one place in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> chap. 4. 15. <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the Harlot, yet let not Judah offend, and come ye not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">See the Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented.</note> 
                        <hi>to Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven nor ſwear the Lord liveth—</hi>where their Idolatry is made to conſiſt in a Religious <hi>Oath</hi> to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, or to <hi>the true God</hi> in the places where the <hi>Calves</hi> were placed.</p>
                     <p>And that they did really intend all that worſhip to the True God, appears further from Chap. 8. v. 13. <hi>They ſacrifice fleſh for the Sacrifices of my Offerings, and eat it; but the Lord accepteth them not.—</hi>And that they applied themſelves to the Calves in thoſe Sacrifices, appears from Chap. 13. 2. <hi>They ſay of them, Let the men that ſacrifice, kiſs the Calves—</hi>which does all belong to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi> and to <hi>Samaria,</hi> who had juſt before been mentioned for their Calves; ſo that their <hi>ſwearing by the Lord,</hi> and their <hi>ſacrificing of his Offerings—</hi>which are ſaid before to be done at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and <hi>Bethaven,</hi> the places of the worſhip of the Calves, cannot poſſibly be underſtood of any other intention of worſhip, than to the True God in the preſence of thoſe Calves. So again Chap. 8. v. 5. <hi>Thy Calf, O Samaria, hath caſt thee off; mine Anger is kindled againſt thee—</hi>where the <hi>kindling God's wrath againſt them</hi> is called <hi>their being caſt off by their Calf,</hi> as they had repreſented the preſence of God in his Houſe by that figure.</p>
                     <p>Now for this kind of Idolatry we need not be long in ſeeking, after the recovery of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire by <hi>Juſtinian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We find, that in the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> about 200 years after, that they inſiſted, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. upon the <hi>old Tradition and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 787. Petav.</note> of the Univerſal Church for the uſe of <hi>Images;</hi> which though it cannot be verified of ſo long a practice of the Church as they pretend, nor (it may be) of that degree of honour, which they defined, for <hi>any time</hi> before, yet we cannot think ſuch an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of men, from all parts of the World, ſo <hi>impudent,</hi> as to plead <hi>ancient Tradition,</hi> and <hi>long practice</hi> for that, to which there had been nothing like in uſe of the Church before their time.</p>
                     <p>But the proof of it, which they alledge out of the 82d Canon of the Sixth Council in <hi>Trullo,</hi> which was near an hundred years before that time, is a very clear inſtance of ſuch practices in the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 707. Petav.</note> Church ſo little a while after <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> That Canon ordains, That <hi>the Image of Chriſt, as the Lamb of God, ſhould be received amongſt the reſt of the Venerable Images—</hi>which gives us to underſtand,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:204884:193"/> that <hi>Images</hi> were then frequent in Churches. And the 73d Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of that Council does intimate to us, what uſe was made of the Images that were made to repreſent the Perſon of Chriſt; For it ordains, That <hi>Adoration ſhould be given to Chriſt by the figure of the Croſs; and to ſhew their reverence to it, that it ſhould never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven upon the Church-floor, leſt it ſhould ſeem to be trampled under foot, and triumphed over.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By both theſe Canons it did appear, that Images were then commonly uſed with great <hi>veneration,</hi> if <hi>not adoration,</hi> in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</p>
                     <p>So common a practice as this, not much above 100 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> may very ſafely be concluded to have been begun in his days; And indeed it is evident to have been then in uſe by that celebrated Act of <note n="*" place="margin">Baronius, <hi>Anno</hi> 591.</note> 
                        <hi>Screnus Biſhop of Marſeils,</hi> in <hi>breaking the Images</hi> that he found to be adored in his Churches; And this was but about 40 years after the death of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and muſt be ſuppoſed to have been ſome while in uſe before it came to be ſo groſly abuſed, as to ſtir up the zeal of <hi>Serenus</hi> to break them, which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt tells him never any Biſhop before him ever did.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Hoſpinian</hi>'s Account of the firſt occaſion of Images in the Church, <hi>Hiſtor. Monachatus, pag.</hi> 49. does agree well with this. He makes the Irruption of the Barbarians upon all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to have been the occaſion of introducing the cuſtome of Images, which they had been always uſed to in their Paganiſm, and were indulged in it upon their converſion in a new way: and their Irruption was long before the time of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> There alſo he affirms, that <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf was the Eſtabliſher of the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> and of the <hi>uſe of Images,</hi> which might well be looked upon as the earneſt of <hi>ſpiritual fornication</hi> in the Church, before they came to be openly adored; and therefore might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate the Church <hi>an Harlot,</hi> as that name may well enough be given to an Adultereſs, from her firſt entertaining of the ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of her Paramour.</p>
                     <p>But even in the days of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> according to <hi>Caranza</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the ſecond Canon of the Second Synod of <hi>Tours,</hi> it appears, that Images were ſo commonly received in the Church, that there was a place ſet a part for them upon the Altar, called by the name of the <hi>Armarium; Caranza Annotat.</hi> on 2d Canon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Synod the Second.</p>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:204884:194"/>
                     <p> And it appears from the 26th Law of <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Code, <hi>Tit. de Epiſcop. &amp; Clero,</hi> that the <hi>Image of the Croſs,</hi> and the <hi>Reliques of the Saints,</hi> were looked upon to be ſo holy, as to be thought fit to have an Imperial Law made, that they ſhould not be ſet up in any Prophane, or Common Places, but only in Religious Houſes. <hi>We decree,</hi> ſays that Law, <hi>that none ſhall endeavour to bring in the</hi> Venerable Croſs, or <hi>the Reliques of the Holy Martyrs, into places made uſe of for the Peoples Sports, or into the Temple of Fortune—For now there is no want of Conſecrated, or Religious places to put them in.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there was another kind of ſpiritual Fornication, which was <hi>certainly</hi> in common uſe before the beginning of the Sixth Century; and that was, <hi>The Invocation of Saints;</hi> And this Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has given an excellent account of, in his Diſcourſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> 1 Epiſt. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                     <p>And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> does acquaint us what the reſt of the World thought in thoſe days, of the practices of the Orthodox of this kind, <hi>Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Fauſtum. Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichee</hi> is there repreſented by him as accuſing the Orthodox Party of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly like the Pagans, in theſe words—<note n="*" place="margin">Idola Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum vertiſtis in Martyres, quos Votis ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus colitis.</note> 
                        <hi>You have turned the Pagan Idols into Martyrs, which ye worſhip with the ſame kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Vigilantius</hi> was a known Stickler in thoſe days againſt the Superſtition of <hi>Saint-worſhip</hi> in the Church: And his Adverſary St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf does commend him for it; and many Biſhops were there of his Party.</p>
                     <p>Indeed it may eaſily be obſerved, that with the converſion of the Empire from Heatheniſm to Chriſtianity, after that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Throne was come into the Church, were by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced moſt of the Ancient Ways of the Heathen Worſhip, with a <hi>new name</hi> only of ſome Chriſtian Ceremony to cover it. So that in effect, it was <hi>Heatheniſm new chriſtened,</hi> or with a <hi>Chriſtian name upon it.</hi> As may be more at large ſeen in the <hi>Third Part of the Church-Homily againſt Idolatry.</hi> And thus came in firſt the Invocation of Saints in imitation of the leſſer Gods of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, of which there was afterwards a moſt remarkable Inſtance of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third's Conſecration of the <hi>Pantheon</hi> for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>Virgin</hi> and of <hi>all the Saints,</hi> which had been before dedicated to the Worſhip of the <hi>Mother of the Gods,</hi> and <hi>all the Leſſer Gods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:204884:194"/>
                     <p> But till the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> theſe Idolatrous Cuſtoms were not preſſed upon the Conſciences of men; whereas in his time it was made a Law, that all that did not communicate in the Church, where theſe things were practiſed, ſhould be <note n="†" place="margin">

                        <hi>baniſhed</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions under the name of Hereticks. And thus, though there might have been the worſhip of the Devil in theſe Adorations of <hi>Daemons,</hi> or of <hi>Souls departed,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> does very critically obſerve, yet it was not the <hi>worſhip of the Beaſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> till it was <hi>inforced</hi> by that Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the Dragon reſigned up to the Beaſt, and which has been found to have had the firſt beginning of its uninterrupted Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Reign of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> Before that time, as it has been ſhown, all the endeavours that were made for it, were by ſome means or other put a ſtop to, and forced to be laid down again. But <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> upon his reuniting the moſt conſiderable part of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire with the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> was in a very fit capacity to accompliſh the Deſign of an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Conformity</hi> to the Worſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; And he did accordingly lay hold of that advantage, and by his Laws, and the execution of them, did very effectually compaſs his Deſign.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ten Kings</hi> alſo, or the reſt of the Crowned Heads, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, were not wanting on their parts to contribute their aſſiſtance to him at that time. They did <hi>ſo unanimouſly give their Kingdoms, and their Power and Strength</hi> to this Deſign of the <hi>Roman</hi> Head or Beaſt (as the Prophecy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it) that at the end of that Age, there was no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appearance of any other Faith and Worſhip in publick all over the extent of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but only that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>

                           <hi>Teſtimonies of the beſt Learned Men amongst the</hi> Jews, <hi>and</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>both of the</hi> Roman <hi>and</hi> Reformed Church, <hi>concerning the General Agreement of the Ancients in making the</hi> Fourth Beaſt <hi>in the</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT may ſeem to have been very evidently demonſtrated from a full and cloſe Examination of the Prophetical Schemes in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> That the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in the 7th Chapter, is the <hi>Kingdom of the Romans.</hi> But all the rational proof that can be brought for it, will not be able to free it from very ſtrong ſuſpicions, if that be true which <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Prophetica pars libri</hi> Danie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, <hi>ſive poſterioraſex capita, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor illius Viſiones continent, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus res quidem una eademque ſed diverſis modis indicatur.—Primam, ſecundam &amp; quartam Viſionem</hi> (i. e. <hi>cap.</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11, <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.) <hi>de</hi> Antiochi Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanis <hi>temporibus intelligunt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè omnes, qui poſt</hi> Joſephum <hi>eâ de re ſcripſerunt.</hi>
                        </note> Sir <hi>John Marſham</hi> has poſitively affirmed about it in his <hi>Canon Chronicus,</hi> pag. 610. <hi>Edit. Lipſ. viz.</hi> That <hi>almoſt all thoſe who wrote after the time of</hi> Joſephus, <hi>about the Viſions in that 7th chapter, as well as thoſe in the 8th and 11th chapter of</hi> Daniel, did underſtand them of the Exploits of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes:</hi> For this would make any think, that are ſwayed by great Authorities, (as the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the world are), That this general agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Ancients in their Applications of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in the 7th Chapter, to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, muſt in all reaſon be thought to be the moſt obvious and natural ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the place; and this would ſhake the whole founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that has been demonſtrated of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which relies all upon the uniform Acceptation of the like Schemes in <hi>Daniel,</hi> from the Certainty of the ſignification of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in the 7th Chapter.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:204884:212"/>
                     <p> Wherefore, beſides the cloſe Proof of it from the Prophecy it ſelf, it will be very requiſite to ſhew, in further confirmation of this Concluſion, That it is ſo far from being the general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the Ancients, that the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> does ſignifie any thing elſe, that it is certainly their almoſt unanimous Conſent, That it is nothing but the Empire of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This will both take off all ſuſpicion of the ſtrength of the proof that has been given for it, and add a new confirmation of it, from Authority, from the general Conſent of all Writers of different Parties, Opinions, and Intereſts, That it is the moſt eaſily offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Prophecy, and the moſt obvious of any other Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of it.</p>
                     <p>But that alſo which makes this Deſign the more neceſſary, is, the Rule that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has ſet up for the Orthodox way of interpreting Scripture, in the ſecond Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Can. 3. <hi>viz. That none ſhould preſume to interpret Scripture againſt the unanimous Conſent of the Fathers:</hi> By which we have the Approbation of the chief Adverſary in our preſent Caſe, for the ſoundneſs of any thing that has this Authority for it; and the mouths of all its Members are hereby ſtopped from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that which is ſo confirmed.</p>
                     <p>For a clearer ſatisfaction in this, I will give the Tradition of it from the ſeveral Writers in every Century of the firſt Ages after Chriſt. But for thoſe that may account that either tedious or uncertain, it will be ſufficient to hear what the Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of all Parties have delivered as the common Conſent of the Ancients.</p>
                     <p>As for the Judgment of the moſt Learned of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it has been particularly ſhewn, in the Preface to my <note place="margin">Judgments of God upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</note> Second Part, That their beſt Commentators, <hi>Malvenda, Viega, Alcaſar, Pererius,</hi> do with a great deal of Heat and Zeal affirm, That <hi>All</hi> find it <hi>unqueſtionable, both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Chriſtians; That it is <hi>commonly agreed upon by all</hi> that profeſs the Name of Chriſt, That it is the <hi>common Road,</hi> and the <hi>King's High-way;</hi> That it is the <hi>common Opinion of the Learned;</hi> That <hi>all do</hi> interpret it ſo; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and look upon it as a <hi>perfect madneſs,</hi> and to ſhew ones felf <hi>void of ſenſe,</hi> to think otherwiſe. <hi>Gaſpar Sanctius</hi> gives a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable reaſon to this purpoſe, why it is needleſs to name any of the Ancients of this Opinion; and that is, <hi>Becauſe there is no</hi>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:204884:212"/> 
                        <hi>Body that ſays otherwiſe.</hi> And this Teſtimony of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is ſo much the more unqueſtionable, becauſe they can make no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it by affirming it, but, on the contrary, do thereby grant the main Foundation of their Adverſaries Applications of the <hi>Revelations</hi> to their Church, which makes their Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Conſent of the Ancients in this, appear to be clear and impartial.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> may be more reaſonably ſuſpected of partiality, becauſe of his particular engagements in the Interpretations of the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> but yet never do we find his Integrity queſtioned for miſrepreſenting the Opinions of the Authors that he quotes. And thus does he ſpeak of the Application of the <hi>Fourth Kingdom</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> pag. 964.<hi>—This has been the conſtant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, ſince the Apoſtles days to this laſt</hi> ſaeculum, <hi>and was of the Church of the</hi> Jews, <hi>before and at our Saviour's time,</hi> viz. <hi>That it was the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rabbi Abarbenel</hi>'s Teſtimony is ſufficient for the Conſent of the <note place="margin">Comment in <hi>Dan.</hi> Pag. 42. Col. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers, being known to be one of the moſt Learned of their Nation.<hi>—Our Maſters</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are right in THEIR TRADITION, That the</hi> Fourth Beaſt <hi>does ſignifie the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperours;</hi> whereby it appears to have been the <hi>common Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Learned <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here then have we the moſt impartial Judgment of the Learned Moderns of <hi>All Parties,</hi> Jews and Chriſtians, That both the Ancient Fathers, and the Ancient Rabbi's are all unanimous in this Interpretation of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the moſt authentick Teſtimony of the Conſent of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in this, is that of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who is known to have been the moſt curious and diligent in his ſearch into the Writings of the Learned in his time, as appears from his Book <hi>De Scriptoribus Eccleſiaſticis.—</hi>In his Explication of the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> after he had animadverted upon <hi>Porphyry</hi>'s Opinion as a <hi>perfect madneſs,</hi> who would have the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> to be a part of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, he concludes thus:<hi>—Let us therefore affirm that which ALL ECCLESIASTICAL WRITERS have delivered to us, That about the end of the World, when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the</hi> Romans <hi>is to be deſtroyed, there ſhall be Ten Kings, who ſhall divide the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire amongſt themſelves; and there ſhall ariſe after them an eleventh ſmall King,</hi> &amp;c. Where we ſee plainly, that by the Beaſt its ſelf was univerſally underſtood the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204884:213"/> This he affirms to have been an Univerſal Tradition of Church-writers before him. And what is there almoſt in the whole Body of our Religion, that has a more Authentick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of being an <hi>unqueſtionable Tradition of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is further confirmed by the <hi>general Cuſtom</hi> of the Chriſtians in the firſt Ages to pray for the Safety of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, leſt the Ruin of <hi>that</hi> ſhould bring on the times of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and the end of the world, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> does affirm of them in that known place of his <hi>Apology;</hi> and <hi>Lactantius, Theophylact,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> are cited by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in confirmation <note place="margin">Lib. 3. <hi>De Pontif.</hi> Cap. 5.</note> of the ſame general Cuſtom of the Church in After-times. And it is apparent from all the mentions of Antichriſt amongſt the Fathers, That they make him to be the ſame with the <hi>Little Horn</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Daniel;</hi> which ſhews, that they made the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> to be certainly after the time of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy, becauſe the end of it with the <hi>Little Horn</hi> was to bring on the end of the World. Therefore does <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>cap.</hi> 29. <hi>lib.</hi> 20. <hi>Auguſtin. ad Marcellin.</hi> reckon up <hi>Lactantius</hi> with St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to affirm, That <hi>all Writers had agreed in that Opinion, That the times of Antichriſt was to be after the diviſion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire,</hi> as it is ſet out by the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> and <hi>Little Horn</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Teſtimonies about the general Senſe of the Ancients of all Churches about this Point, may ſeem to be a ſufficient proof of their Judgments about it: But becauſe ſome of late very * eminent for Learning and Ingenuity, have fancied another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt;</hi> and eſpecially, becauſe one of them, † as much famed for an Antiquary as any of them, has poſitively affirmed it to be the general Judgment of the Ancients, That the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> is quite another thing than the <hi>Romans;</hi> it may be more ſatisfactory, to ſet down here the Tradition of every Century of the Chriſtian Church concerning this, almoſt ever ſince the <hi>Romans</hi> came to be that <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> at their Conqueſt of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt on the Prophets, is the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence, but Scripture, what was the current Opinion of the times near our Saviour about the Four Monarchies of <hi>Daniel;</hi> for he both lived about thoſe times, and his Expoſition was always reverenced by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Authority, that <hi>none ever dared to contradict it,</hi> ſays <hi>Lyranus,</hi> in Comment. on <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Iſai.</hi> And <hi>Galatinus,—That they reverence it almoſt as much as the Text it ſelf.</hi> So that this may be very well accounted the Senſe of the whole Body of the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe days.</p>
                        <p>He has not, indeed, any Comment upon the Book of <hi>Daniel:</hi> But in his Paraphraſe upon the four laſt Verſes of the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> the <hi>Four Horns</hi> there, <hi>that ſcattered the Men of Judah and Jeruſalem,</hi> he determines to be <hi>Four Kingdoms</hi> capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the <hi>Jews.</hi> And ſo alſo on the 6th Chapter, v. 5. he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the ſame four Kingdoms coming after one another. What he did particularly underſtand by theſe four Kingdoms, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in the Paraphraſe upon <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 3. 17. concerning the end of the Nations that ſhould captivate the <hi>Jews: For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Kingdom of</hi> Babel <hi>ſhall not remain, nor exerciſe Dominion in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>the Kings of</hi> Media <hi>ſhall be ſlain, and the ſtrong Ones of</hi> Grecia <hi>ſhall not proſper; the</hi> Romans <hi>ſhall be rooted out, nor ſhall they gather Tribute at</hi> Jeruſalem. Now it was always agreed, That whatſoever the <hi>Four Kingdoms</hi> in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> were in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, yet that they were four ſucceſſive Monarchies that ſhould mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out <hi>the whole time of the Captivity</hi> of the Church of God from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Conqueſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the time of the Kingdom of the Son of Man; and that the end of this Captivity was to be at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:204884:214"/> the end of the Times of the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> as it is alſo expreſly ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. When therefore <hi>Zechariah,</hi> who was one of the next Prophets to <hi>Daniel in the Captivity,</hi> is by the Paraphraſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſignifie four ſucceſſive Kingdoms <hi>captivating</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>ſcattering</hi> them (which is <hi>Daniel</hi>'s own expreſſion for it, <hi>ibid.)</hi> And when the only Conquerours and Enſlavers of that Nation are mentioned by the ſame Paraphraſt to be the <hi>Babylonian, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchies; it is manifeſt, That he does thereby determine the four Kingdoms <hi>captivating</hi> the Church of God in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to be thoſe four Monarchies only; and therefore, That the laſt of the four is the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy. And this is ſufficient to ſhew it to be then the general Opinion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church at that time, That the fourth Kingdom in the 7th chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> was the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                        <p>And this Opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe times, was made to be the Faith of Chriſtians alſo in thoſe days by our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (ſo far, at leaſt, as to aſſure that fourth Kingdom not to belong to the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy, which is all the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern), in his Prophecies every-where about the Kingdom and Coming of the Son of Man; which has been found unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to be meant of the ſame Kingdom that in the 7th of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> is alſo called, <hi>The Kingdom of the Son of Man, and of the Saints,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Proof of the 13th and 14th <hi>Propoſitions.</hi> And then that Kingdom of the Son of Man being ſignified by Chriſt not then to be come, nor to be expected till at leaſt ſome while after his Death, that is, not till long after the end of the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy; and yet being deſcribed in <hi>Daniel</hi> to come to the deſtruction of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> or Kingdom there, does make it ſure, That that <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> and Kingdom, could not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be any part of the Reign of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt it be that which ſucceeded the Reign of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or the Reign of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if the <hi>Third Beaſt</hi> before it were the beginning of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, as it is here by all acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be.</p>
                        <p>A ſtill more particular Determination of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> and Kingdom in <hi>Daniel,</hi> to the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is that exact Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the ſame Kingdom in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John;</hi> and that alſo fixed to <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Seat of its Empire. See <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 15. Which all the Ancients before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> looked upon to be ſo plainly ſet out as a <hi>Roman</hi> Domination, that there was no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:204884:214"/> doubt of it. And this is a laſting Teſtimony of the Senſe of the Chriſtian Church about it in thoſe times. And when St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before this, deſcribes the laſt Coming of Chriſt, as the Son of Man in his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. he does it with juſt the ſame deſcription of it, and of that eminent <hi>Oppoſer</hi> of the Church of God, juſt before his Coming, as the Coming of the Son of Man is ſet out in the 7th chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> by the Deſtruction of the <hi>Little Horn</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> which therefore could no ways belong to the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy that was paſt. And then, by his appeal to their knowledge of what it was, that <hi>did then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> that Enemy from appearing, he plainly intimates, That that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt come after the time of that Ruling Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was then Reigning. This alſo does ſhew, That it was a commonly-known thing amongſt the Chriſtians of thoſe days, that the time of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> or Kingdom that was next before the Second Coming of Chriſt, was not then paſt, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire was. And this may ſuffice for the Judgment of the Apoſtolical times, about the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel.</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:204884:215"/> muſt make the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> or Kingdom that it is there deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to deſtroy, to continue till that time, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not poſſible to be the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy; and then, ſince it is as manifeſt that the firſt of thoſe four Beaſts is ſaid to be <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>'s <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 44. &amp; 7. 2.</note> Kingdom, or the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the fourth from thence muſt at fartheſt be the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But I will only pick out thoſe amongſt them that have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſomething relating to this <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> together with that Coming of the Son of Man.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> is the next conſiderable Remainder of Antiquity after the times of the Apoſtles: In his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> he cites the 7th chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> to prove <hi>the Second Coming of Chriſt in Glory to be generally expected by all Chriſtians after the times of that ACC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RSED One, who is there ſet out as ſpeaking great words againſt the Moſt High;</hi> and who is there by <hi>Juſtin</hi> judged to be <hi>juſt then at hand,</hi> whoſe <hi>time, times, and half a time,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Daniel had foretold.—</hi>By which it appears, That the Opinion of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was, That the <hi>Little Horn</hi> of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> did ſignifie ſome King, who ſhould appear out of the Empire in which he himſelf lived; and ſo did ſuppoſe the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.<hi>—Trypho</hi> does alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That <hi>that Prophecy did make the</hi> Jews <hi>expect one like the Son of Man, who ſhould take upon him an Eternal Kingdom;</hi> that is, their Meſſiah; which did plainly exclude the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire from being any thing of the fourth Kingdom. For upon the end of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> or Kingdom, in that place of <hi>Daniel,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeds the Kingdom of the Son of Man; whereas the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire had then been paſt for near 200 years, and yet there had been no appearance of their Meſſiah. And thus have we, in this Teſtimony, both the Judgment of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in thoſe days about this matter, in <hi>Trypho</hi>'s words; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of <hi>All Chriſtians</hi> at that time, in <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s.</p>

                              <hi>But yet ſtill much more manifeſtly hath</hi> John, a Diſciple of our Lord, ſet out to us in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe,</hi> the laſt time of it; and the Ten Kings, who are in it, amongſt whom that Empire, which NOW REIGNETH,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:204884:215"/> ſhall be divided, <hi>declaring what were thoſe Ten Horns that were ſeen by</hi> Daniel.—And again,<hi>—Daniel</hi> did diligently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifie the dividing and ſharing of the fourth Kingdom at the end of it, by the <hi>Ten Toes</hi> of the Image.—And ſpeaking of the Number of the Beaſt, which he had before made to be a time of the fourth Beaſt in <hi>Daniel,</hi> cap. 24. he pitches upon <hi>Latinos,</hi>

                           <hi>Jerom</hi> is ſo much of this Opinion himſelf in his Comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Daniel,</hi> that almoſt all his deſign in it is to expoſe <hi>Porphyry</hi> the Philoſopher, for interpreting the <hi>Fourth Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Little Horn</hi> of it, to be the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, and <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> in it: And to ſhew the Paradoxicalneſs of that Interpretation, he ſays upon the latter-end of the 11th Chapter, That <hi>all Eccleſiaſtical Writers</hi> did underſtand the Fourth Beaſt, and the Ten Horns, and Eleventh little One in it, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding it among Ten Kings, and of Antichriſt that ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Three of them.</p>

In his 38 <hi>Epiſt. ad Conſtant. lib.</hi> 4. he applies all the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> to thoſe that would arrogate to themſelves the Title

                        <p>Becauſe after this, there is no different mention of any other Interpretation of the Fourth Beaſt in <hi>Daniel, Ambroſius Ausber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> may be the general Repreſentative of the Opinion of all thoſe of latter date, till the time of the Reformation—He, upon the 13th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> makes <hi>the Beaſt under the healed Head, to be the ſame with the Little Horn of the Fourth Beaſt in</hi> Daniel.—And upon the 17th Chapter <hi>compares that Beaſt with the Fourth Beaſt in</hi> Daniel;—And there adds<hi>—For what can be underſtood by the Fourth Beaſt, but the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, in which thoſe Ten Kings are mentioned, after whom Antichriſt is to ariſe?</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>FRom the preceding Teſtimonies of the Fathers, it appears, That however different the Ancients might have been in particular Opinions about the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> yet they are found unanimouſly to agree in theſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Concluſions.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That the notion of the Fourth Beaſt in general, as <note place="margin">CONSENT of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note> the common ſubject of all its Horns, is, The <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</item>
                        <item>2. That the Ten Horns of it, are a diviſion of that Monarchy into ſo many ſeveral Kingdoms under Ten Kings.</item>
                        <item>3. That the Little Horn of that Beaſt is Antichriſt, that ſhould have a Kingdom within the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</item>
                        <item>4. That the Kingdom of Antichriſt ſhould continue, till it ſhould be deſtroyed by the Second Coming of Chriſt, after the time that they wrote in.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Victorinus</hi> was indeed ſingular about the laſt of theſe. For he judged Antichriſt to have been a ſingle Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> about the time of the Viſion. But that was eſteemed as very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant by others. <q>Some think (ſays <hi>Auguſtine ad Marcellin. Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.) that <hi>Nero</hi> is meant by the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> 2 Theſſal. 2. 4. But I <hi>extremely admire</hi> at their preſumption, or their raſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other Agreements of the Ancients about theſe matters are inſtanced in by <hi>Bellarmine, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Pontifice,</hi> ſome of which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:204884:218"/> muſt indeed be granted; But they are ſuch, as are no ground of concluding upon the ſenſe of the place to which they refer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves do often acknowledge themſelves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable Judges of the determinate Signification of thoſe things, upon the account of their ignorance of the Event, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, and by which alone they apprehended them capable of being certainly known.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon the 12th Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> 8, 9. where the Prophet profeſſes he <hi>underſtood not what he heard;</hi> And the Angel confirms it to be, becauſe <hi>the words were ſealed up;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>many ſhould underſtand—</hi>explains it thus—<q>But when the thing ſhall come to paſs, they ſhall plainly underſtand the things that were foretold.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So alſo <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis,</hi> concerning the <hi>number of the name</hi> of the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.—<q>The exact knowledge (ſays he) of the number, and of every thing elſe beſides, that is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>about Antichriſt,</hi> Time and Experience will diſcover to Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Sober Enquirers.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> upon the ſame matter judges it to have been on <note place="margin">Lib. 5. cont. Haereſ. cap. ult.</note> purpoſe concealed, that it might not be known, till it came to be fulfilled—And after Cautions put in againſt Conjectures—<q>'Tis therefore, (ſays he) much the ſurer way to ſtop our Conjectures till the Prophecy be fulfilled.—</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is given as a general Rule for every thing of this nature, that is not very plain and clear before the Event; By which it appears, That the Fathers did not think themſelves in a capacity to determine the meaning of the particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Prophecies about Antichriſt, becauſe they were generally agreed, that he was ſtill to come; And that therefore the particular Characters of his appearance did depend upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents in after-times for the clear underſtanding them.</p>
                     <p>Now all thoſe Opinions, for which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> cites the Conſent <note place="margin">N B.</note> of the Fathers, are ſuch as depend upon this Suppoſition; That <hi>the Time, Times, and the dividing of Time,</hi> which is the time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the continuance of the Little Horn in the 7th of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 25.</note> do not ſignify any longer time than Three years and an half, according to the common acceptation of <hi>A Time</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this account it is, that many Fathers have agreed, that Antichriſt muſt be a ſingle Perſon; and conſequently, That the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204884:219"/> Ten Kings ſignified by the Ten Horns, muſt alſo be ſo many ſingle Kings, as well as the Little Horn, that denotes Antichriſt; It is alſo for this reaſon, that they agree, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire muſt be ruined at his appearance, by the Ten Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe by this his Time is made to be but Three years and an half before the end of the World, or the Second Coming of Chriſt, unto which the time of the Little Horn is deſcribed to continue.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers indeed might eaſily be induced to take <hi>the Times,</hi> or 1260 <hi>days</hi> of Antichriſt, in the literal ſenſe; becauſe they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under the Reign of the Sixth Head of the Beaſt, which had ruled from the time of the Viſion, they ſaw no neceſſity for that ſenſe, in which days and weeks are uſed amongſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſo were then obliged to judge according to the Firſt Rule of all ſound Interpretation. Chap. 2. Book I. of this Part.</p>
                     <p>But the Agreement of the Fathers in theſe things, is not ſo perfectly <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimous,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> would make it to be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this very place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> tells him, That by <hi>A Time,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves underſtand ſometimes an 100 years, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which (ſays he) <hi>the Man of Sin</hi> muſt needs reign 355 years.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Auguſtin. ad Marcellin. Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.—Some (ſays he) underſtand by <hi>the Man of Sin,</hi> not one Prince only, but, as it were, <hi>an whole Body,</hi> that is, a great Multitude of Men.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Primaſius,</hi> ſpeaking of the Beaſt, and the Falſe Prophet, <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </note> that is, ſays he, the Devil, and Antichriſt, or his Chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and his <hi>whole Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So alſo do we find in the Teſtimonies of <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hippolitus, Lactantius, Victorinus, Jerom,</hi> that they made the Ten Horns of the Beaſt to be no more than <hi>a Diviſion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire;</hi> whereas <hi>Bellarmin</hi> pretends, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are agreed, that they ſignify the utter deſtruction of that Empire.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis</hi> does expreſly contradict him in this in his Teſtimony; where he ſays, <q>That <hi>moſt of the Ancient Doctors</hi>
                        </q> did underſtand Ten Kings of <hi>the Roman Empire,</hi> by the Ten Horns of the Beaſt.</p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:204884:219"/>
                     <p> There are many other things, for which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings the Conſent of the Fathers, in which he has been found to be much miſtaken; particularly by Biſhop <hi>Andrews. Reſponſ. ad Bellarmin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now from the former Conſiderations about the Agreement, and the differences of the Opinions of the Ancients, it may be obſerved, That their Teſtimonies about things that the Church has not poſitively defined, as the preſent caſe is, are of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all other humane Teſtimony. Where they <hi>all agree</hi> in a ſenſe of <hi>which they were capable Judges</hi> in their time, it is a very great preſumption, that it is the plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe of that place; But where they differ from one another, their Authority is to be reſolved into the ſtrength of the grounds of their particular Opinions: And thoſe amongſt them who in any particular circumſtances ſpeak things contradictory to what was ſo generally agreed on from the plain evidence of the Text, may be as little our concern, as the Paradoxical Opinions of ſome Learned Men in our own Age. They themſelves, we have ſeen, do acknowledge themſelves uncapable Judges of moſt of the things in the Prophecy of Antichriſt, and the abſolute need there was of further time and experience of the Events, to be able to ſpeak with any likelihood of truth about them.</p>
                     <p>The uſe therefore that is to be made of theſe Agreements of the Ancients about the places of the Prophecy, of <hi>which they were capable Judges</hi> at that time, is, To confirm the natural ſenſe that is offered from the Text, and not to give any a prejudice againſt new ſenſes of the Prophecy about ſuch things in this Age, ſo many Ages ſince it was wrote: And as ſtrong a preſumption is it againſt the fixing of the full accompliſhment of the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to any Events before, or in the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Grotius.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>
                        </note> time of the Fathers, to ſee them ſo generally to agree in their ſilence about any ſuch Interpretation. It would indeed be matter of aſtoniſhment to us, if the things of theſe Prophecies ſhould have been paſt before the times of theſe Learned Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers into the meaning of them; And yet that they ſhould una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly agreee, that they were not to be fulfilled till a long time after.</p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:204884:220"/>
                     <p> From the General Agreement of the Ancients in the things at firſt mentioned, theſe ſeem to be neceſſary Conſequences, that they muſt be ſuppoſed to own.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> muſt be <note place="margin">Conſequences.</note> underſtood a Kingdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>laſt end</hi> of the Beaſt, with all its Horns. For by the ſame reaſon that they took that Beaſt to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy in any part of its time, they muſt alſo own it to be the ſame in all the mentions of it, or in any time of its Horns; As the Third Beaſt is the Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in in all the time of its four Heads, or its four Horns, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 8. They were all ſaid in the 8th Chapter, to be the King of <hi>Grecia:</hi> that is, One Ruling Nation at firſt united, and afterwards divided. And therefore the Little Horn, and the Ten of the Fourth Beaſt, muſt be as much <hi>Roman</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, as the Little Horn, and the five other in the He-Goat, Chap. 8. were <hi>Graecian</hi> Rulers.</p>
                     <p>And this ſhews how contradictory it was to the notion of the Fourth Beaſt, in which all the Fathers agreed, to make the Ten Kings in it, to be <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> and Ruiners of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom, as ſome of the Fathers did imagine. And therefore by the Ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they muſt be underſtood to mean nothing but the ruining the <hi>entire form</hi> of it, as the breaking a thing in pieces is called the ruine and deſtruction of it; but no more the end of the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom, than the four Horns of the Goat were the end of the Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From hence alſo does it follow, That the Ten Horns, and the Little Horn of the Fourth Beaſt, are a time of <hi>Roman</hi> Rule.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Kingdom of Antichriſt, or the Little Horn of the Fourth Beaſt, is to begin among the <hi>Romans,</hi> after the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Monarchy into Ten Kingdoms, and is to continue from its firſt Riſe to the Second Coming of Chriſt in Glory. For the Little Horn continues with the Fourth Beaſt till it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Kingdom of the Son of Man.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the notion of a Beaſt all over <hi>Daniel,</hi> is <hi>the Monarchy of one Conquering Nation only from the time of its Conqueſt to the laſt end of it.</hi> For there is a general Agreement, that the other Three Beaſts in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> do ſignify the <hi>Babylonian, Perſian</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchies, till they came to be ſubdued. And the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:204884:220"/> Two Beaſts in the 8th Chapter are ſaid expreſly to be of the ſame kind; The Ram is called <hi>the Kings of Media and Perſia;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">V. 20. V. 3.</note> and the <hi>Two Horns,</hi> are repreſented as riſing up <hi>the one after the other,</hi> to denote the ſucceſſion of the <hi>Perſian</hi> to the <hi>Median</hi> Line, till he is there ſubdued by the He-goat: The He-goat alſo, tho he be called the King of <hi>Greece</hi> in the ſingle Perſon, yet is ſaid to have four Kings ſucceeding after one great one, ſet forth by a <note place="margin">V. 21, 22.</note> firſt great Horn, and four riſing up after it, and is deſcribed to continue to the latter time of that Kingdom, whoſe Character is <note place="margin">V. 23.</note> owned to be the fourfold Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That the ſignification of Heads and Horns of Beaſt all over <hi>Daniel,</hi> is, The ſeveral Supreme Powers in that Nation, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is repreſented in general by the Beaſt. If theſe Heads, or Horns, be ſaid <hi>to come one after another,</hi> they denote a ſucceſſion of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> different Supreme Magiſtracies in the ſame place; But if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as riſing up <hi>altogether,</hi> they ſignify the diviſion of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nation into ſo many diſtinct Sovereignties, or Kingdoms; And alſo the <hi>continuance</hi> of each Succeſſion of the Succeſſive Heads, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Horns, and <hi>the continuance</hi> of each diviſion of the Contemporary Heads, or Horns, till the change of either of them.</p>
                     <p>This all agree in, about the four Heads of the Leopard in the 7th Chapter, which ſignify ſo many diſtinct Kingdoms in the <hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy; and about the ſucceſſive Horns of the Ram in the 8th Chapter, which ſignify the Succeſſion of the <hi>Perſian</hi> to the <hi>Median</hi> Government in the ſame Nation of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> according as that Kingdom is called both under the <note place="margin">V. 8, 12, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Median,</hi> and under the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, as thrice in <hi>Daniel</hi> 6. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Medes,</hi> and all over the Book of <hi>Eſther</hi> in the time of the <hi>Perſians.</hi> The Horns of the He-goat alſo in the 8th Chapter, are agreed to repreſent firſt the united Monarchical Government of the <hi>Greeks</hi> under one King, and then the Succeſſion of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Kingdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi> after it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, the Little Horn coming out of one of the four in the 8th Chapter (agreed to be but one ſingle King) makes no change in that fourfold Kingdom, though he be deſcribed as coming after the four. But then it is plainly intimated, that he is not an Horn diſtinct from the other four, but only a part of that, <hi>out of which</hi> he is ſaid to come, and not to come <hi>after</hi> it.</p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:204884:221"/>
                     <p> Wherefore here are eleven acknowledged Inſtances of the proof of the beforementioed Rule about the ſignification of Heads, and Horns; And then for the remaining Ten Horns of the Fourth Beaſt, and Little One after them in the 7th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there wants nothing to aſſure their conformity to it, but to prove, that they belong to the ſame Nation that is repreſented by the Fourth Beaſt there. And that is aſſured from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Conſequence. For theſe Horns are but parts of that Beaſt, which in the whole time of it, ſignifies but one Nation only.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers indeed do ſeem generally to agree, That the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horn of the Fourth Beaſt, and conſequently the Ten before him, can be nothing but <hi>Roman</hi> Powers, whatſoever is pretended to the contrary. <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis,</hi> in his Teſtimony before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, expreſly ſays, <q>That the <hi>Ancient Doctors</hi> made <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> to be <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they looked upon the Beaſt there (whoſe City <hi>Babylon</hi> is) to be the ſame with the Little Horn upon the Fourth Beaſt, or the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</q> And <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> does as good as ſay the ſame, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Pontif. c.</hi> 16. The <hi>Fathers</hi> ſay, that Antichriſt was to come as a Monarch of that Empire, the Seat of which had been at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus for inſtance, When <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells <hi>Trypho</hi> that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (ſignified by the Little Horn) <hi>was juſt at hand</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was then flouriſhing, who could underſtand that of any thing but the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire? When <hi>Irenaeus</hi> gueſſes his name to be <hi>Latinos,</hi> becauſe that, he ſays, was the name of his Kingdom, he does plainly fix him upon the <hi>Romans.</hi> When <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes the Ten Kings of <hi>the Roman Empire</hi> to bring on Antichriſt, and ſays, <hi>That his time is at hand,</hi> that is, in the height of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, he intimates the ſame thing. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polytus</hi> makes him to ariſe amongſt the Ten Kings, whom he calls the Kings of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that make the Kingdom of the Stone, or of the God of <note place="margin">V. 44.</note> Heaven, in the 2d Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the ſame with that of the Son of Man in the 7th Chapter, muſt alſo judge the Fourth Kingdom before it, in each to be the ſame; And the Fourth Kingdom in the 2d Chapter is ſaid to be the ſame Kingdom in ſubſtance, when it was <hi>entire,</hi> and when <hi>divided,</hi> verſe 40, 41. <hi>Lactantius</hi> applies the whole account of the Fourth Beaſt to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204884:221"/> 
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Victorinus</hi> doth certainly ſeat Antichriſt, or the Little Horn, amongſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Rulers.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe indeed that came after the time of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them think, that <hi>Antichriſt was to deſtroy all the Power of</hi> Rome. The only ground that they alledge for it, is, That in the Second Epiſtle of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> chap. 2. where it is ſaid, <hi>That that did withhold</hi> at the preſent time, muſt <hi>be taken away,</hi> and then ſhould the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> be Revealed. This <hi>that did with-hold,</hi> they Interpreted to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And yet ſince they afterwards Interpret <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to be <hi>Rome,</hi> which is openly deſcribed to be the City of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (the ſame with the little Horn) whom they agreed to continue till about the end of the World, they did thereby plainly ſhew, that they meant nothing elſe <hi>by the taking away</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the forecited place, but <hi>only the change of the Monarchical Imperial form of it, not the laſt end of all</hi> Roman <hi>Rule; According as</hi> Tertullian <hi>ſays, that they prayed for the Lives of the Emperors to put off the coming of</hi> Antichriſt <hi>in the end of the World.</hi> As for thoſe amongſt them that did not underſtand <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Babylon,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">See the Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to the <hi>1ſt</hi> Chap. Book 1.</note> we ſee that the Jeſuits themſelves look upon them as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant in it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Ten Horns, and the Little one after them, may now be counted by the expreſs Conſent of the Fathers, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the General Rule for all the reſt of their kind.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It does alſo now appear from this Agreement of the Fathers concerning <hi>Beaſts, and their parts,</hi> ſignifying Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That they had no other mark for their difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt either Succeſſive, or Contemporary Horns, but <hi>only the different Changes of the Supream Civil Power of Monarchies.</hi>

                     <p>THE Conſent of the Ancients about the nature of the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the neceſſary Conſequences of what they expreſly conſent in, do diſcover what they muſt agree in concerning the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Fathers are well enough known to make that which from the 13th, to the end of the 19th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> is peculiarly called The Beaſt (as one <hi>particular</hi> ſtate of it only in the latter time of it) to be that, to which they give the name of Antichriſt. See <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They do upon this account make that <hi>particular</hi> Reign of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to be <hi>the ſame</hi> with the Reign of the Little Horn of the Fourth Beaſt in <hi>Daniel, the ſame</hi> with the Man of Sin in the 2d Chapter of the Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, the ſame</hi> alſo with the Buſtling King in <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. 36.

The Fathers do alſo own with the Text, the ſeven Heads of <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 10, 11.</note> the Beaſt to be ſucceſſive Ruling Powers, five of which were paſt <hi>at the time of the Viſion,</hi> one of them at that time in being, and two Kings more which were to come to make up the whole Seven, the latter of which Two was to be ſuch an Eighth, as ſhould be one of the Seven.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They did alſo agree that <hi>Babylon,</hi> that went along with the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> was the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> This appears from <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis</hi>'s Teſtimony, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Quotations of the Fathers for this Expoſition, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 2. where he concludes it to be the Opinion of the Fathers, <hi>That</hi> John <hi>in the</hi> Apocalypſe <hi>did every-where call</hi> Rome, Babylon.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>from</hi> the forementioned Particulars, in which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients are found generally to agree about the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the immediate, and neceſſary Conſequences before deduced from them, I would propound it to the Impartial Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the World, whether to make the Ancients conſtant to themſelves, they ought not to be judged to agree alſo in thoſe unavoidable Conſequences of the Concluſions, in which they are ſo unanimous.</p>
                     <p>That the general Notion of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> as it <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>1</label> is the <hi>common ſubject</hi> of its Heads and Horns, muſt ſignify, <hi>the Particular Monarchy of the</hi> Romans, till the laſt ruine of it. This does neceſſarily follow, 1ſt, From the fourth Conſequence of <note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> their Agreements about the Fourth Beaſt in the 7th of <hi>Daniel.</hi> For by that the general Notion of every Beaſt is to be <hi>ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Monarchy to the laſt end of it. And 2dly, From their <note place="margin">See 4th Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Chap.</note> Unanimous Agreement about <hi>Babylon</hi> in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, which does neceſſarily determine it to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if ſome of the Fathers have interpreted the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> to ſignify, a great Multitude of Kingdoms, tyrannizing over the Church of God, They do plainly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict that, which before they had agreed to be the natural and obvious ſignification of <hi>A Beaſt</hi> in Prophecy, by the almoſt Unanimous Conſent of all Interpreters, that is, a <hi>particular Kingdom only;</hi> Whereas in this way, they make one Beaſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify as many, as a multitude of Beaſts every-where elſe;

                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe therefore of the Fathers, who make the ſeven Heads to be either ſo <hi>many Ages</hi> of the World, or ſo many diſtinct <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,</hi> do contradict their Agreement with the reſt about the like Figures in <hi>Daniel;</hi> And when others make the Ten Horns to be the <hi>diſſolution</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, though they were the Ten Horns of that Beaſt, that ſignifies the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to the laſt end of it, they forget how inconſiſtent they are with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>Whether by the common Conſent of the Fathers in their other <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>3</label> Agreements, the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> as it is the <hi>particular ſtate</hi> of the Beaſt under its laſt Ruling Head, can be any thing but a <hi>Roman</hi> Sovereign? For it is an Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt, <note place="margin">By Conſeq. 4.

                     <p>Whether the Agreements of the Fathers do not neceſſarily <label type="milestone">

For then the next ſingle Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror but one muſt have been the 8th King, called the Beaſt; Whereas the Fathers are found to agree, that Antichriſt, the <note place="margin">4th Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chap. 3.</note> ſame with the Beaſt, or 8th King, was not come into power in their time, which was never the ſucceſſion of many ſingle Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:204884:223"/> from the time of the Viſion. Beſides, By the 5th Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their Agreements about the Figures of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Chap. 3. They make every Head and Horn of Beaſt to contain in it all the ſingle Rulers of the ſame kind.</p>
                     <p>Whether, according to the agreeing Judgment of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>5</label> the Sixth Head of the Beaſt muſt not be the Imperial Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> till at leaſt the taking away of that Form of Government in that Juriſdiction? For by the 5th Conſequence of their Agreements. Chap. 3. An <hi>Head,</hi> or <hi>Horn</hi> of Beaſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a kind of Supream Power in a Nation to the laſt end of that kind of <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore thoſe of the Fathers, that made the Sixth Head to be at an end at the Change of the Imperial Power from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity, did contradict the Unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all the reſt with themſelves about the nature of every Head and Horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which they made to be <hi>one kind of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Civil Power</hi> to the laſt end of it, without any regard to the different behaviour of ſome of the ſingle Perſons of that kind towards the Church of God, in compariſon with others. The Favour and Protection of the <hi>Jews</hi> from ſome of the <hi>Babylonian, Perſian, Graecian</hi> Kings, did not in the Fathers Opinion make different Heads, or Horns of the Beaſts, to which they did belong.</p>
                     <p>Whether, according to the Opinions of the Ancients, in <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>6</label> which they unanimouſly agreed, The <hi>Seventh King,</hi> or Head, muſt not be that which changed the Imperial Power of <hi>Rome</hi> at the end of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Emperors? For the Imperial Government <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>4</label> of the <hi>Romans</hi> was certainly the Sixth Head; and that muſt then neceſſarily be either that Imperial Government only, which was particularly owned by the Senate, and People, and Clergy of <hi>Rome;</hi> or the whole Imperial Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, over <hi>Rome, Conſtantinople, Britain,</hi> &amp;c. Now at the Fall of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Emperors in <hi>Auguſtulus,</hi> there was a Change of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Form of <hi>Roman</hi> Government, whichſoever of theſe kinds was the Sixth Head. For the Barbarous Kings, that ſucceeded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> were owned as the ſole Sovereigns of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Pope, Senate, People and Clergy. And if it were the whole Imperial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> at <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was the Sixth Head, then the Change of it into the mixt form of Imperial, and Kingly Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the owning the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſh</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:204884:224"/> Kings as the Sovereigns of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Part, muſt be the Seventh King. For they were as much a part of the Supream Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Emperors, which they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. And it has been found by the 6th and 7th Neceſſary <note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> Conſequences of the Agreeing Opinions of the Fathers, That a new Name of the Civil Sovereign Power of a Nation, does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a new Succeſſive Head or Horn of a Beaſt. So is it in the laſt Horn of the Ram, Chap. 8. which is agreed by the Fathers to be the Change of the name of the King of <hi>Media,</hi> to that of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> though the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was alſo King of <hi>Media,</hi> who was the firſt Horn. And ſo was it in the four Horns of the He-goat, <hi>ibidem.</hi> Though one of theſe four be the ſame with the firſt Horn. And the Change of the whole pure Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Goverment into that of either Kingly alone at <hi>Rome,</hi> or into that of the mixt form of Kingly and Imperial, over the whole remaining Empire, was as real a new appearance of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as either of thoſe two Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>After this, it is not to be queſtioned, but that according to <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>7</label> the Fathers, The Eighth King called the Beaſt, and Antichriſt, muſt be that Sovereign Civil Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <note place="margin">Agreements.</note> the Barbarous Kings at <hi>Rome.</hi> For that muſt be the King that was next to the Seventh. And this exactly agrees with the Text; For the Eighth King, called The Beaſt, is ſaid to be <hi>of the Seven;</hi> As the Imperial Government reſtored by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> who ſubdued the <hi>Italian</hi> Kings, was the Eighth Change of the Sovereign Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> but really nothing but the Sixth Head reſtored again.</p>
                     <p>It does alſo as neceſſarily follow from the Agreements of the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Query </seg>8</label> Fathers about the conſtitutive difference of Heads and Horns from one another; That that which is repreſented by the Falſe Prophet, cannot be the ſame thing with that which is called the Beaſt; <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the Beaſt is really nothing but an Head of the Beaſt, which by conſequence the 6th, Chap. 3. does denote <note place="margin">Prop. 6.</note> a Civil Power of the <hi>Romans;</hi> whereas the Falſe Prophet is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as an Eccleſiaſtical Power, employed in the ſervice of that Civil Power. See <hi>Revelat.</hi> 13, 12, 14.</p>
                     <p>But yet they might very well agree, That the Beaſt, and the Falſe Prophet, might be uſed promiſcuouſly to ſignify the really diſtinct Actions of one another; becauſe they were joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one Confederacy; And the names of any Confederates,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:204884:224"/> or Partners, in any thing, are commonly uſed to expreſs the Actions of one another in the common Deſign. So <hi>Primaſius</hi> upon the 13th of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> concerning them both—<q>Both of them, ſays he, are every-where to be underſtood in conjunction—And preſently after—It is manifeſt, that both the Beaſts are one and the ſame body <hi>(of men)</hi> and exerciſe the ſame wicked Worſhip; ſo that the Firſt is ſaid to fight for the falſe Shows of the Second.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have drawn down the Conſequences of the General Conſent of the Ancients, to mine own particular Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt date of the Riſe of the Beaſt, and the particular <hi>Roman</hi> Power that is now ſignified by that Term.</p>
                     <p>But that which is to be obſerved for the General Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Concluſion, in which almoſt all Proteſtants agree in, is, That if it be ſure, as may appear from the 4th Query, That the Sixth Head of the Beaſt is the Imperial Government at the time of the Viſion, then there need nothing be granted to prove <hi>the Beaſt and the Falſe Prophet to be the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Power of</hi> Rome <hi>at this preſent,</hi> but only to demonſtrate from Hiſtory, That there has certainly been two Changes of the Sovereign Power of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſince the time of St. <hi>John.</hi> For they did agree, That Antichriſt, from his firſt appearance, muſt continue <note place="margin">4th Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Chap. 3. 3d Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Chap.</note> till the Second Coming of Chriſt; and that the next Change of the Sovereignty of the <hi>Romans</hi> but one, after the time of the Viſion, muſt be the Eighth King, or the Beaſt, and Antichriſt; And therefore at the beginning of the laſt of thoſe two Changes of the Government of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſince the time of St. <hi>John,</hi> muſt the Kingdom of Antichriſt have begun, whenſoever that does appear from Hiſtory to have happened.</p>
                     <p>And whatſoever the Fathers have delivered contrary to this, concerning the <hi>Time, Times, and half a Time</hi> of the Beaſt, as but three years and an half, muſt have been acknowledged by them to contradict their General Agreements in other things more plain; and from <hi>Experience,</hi> which they often mention, as the only means to determine the meaning of ſome Myſtical Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that regarded future Times, they would have learnt that thoſe Times were neceſſarily to be underſtood in a Myſtical Senſe, and not as they ordinarily ſignify; according to the frequent Examples in Scripture of ſuch a Myſtical Signification of parts of <note place="margin">See Corol. 1. Prop. 23. Rule 2.</note> time, and the true Rule of Interpretation in ſuch like Caſes.</p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:204884:225"/>
                     <p> For a clearer ſatisfaction about the contrariety and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of ſome of the particular Opinions of the Fathers, with the Concluſions in which they agree with the Unanimous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſt; it may be convenient to inquire into the grounds, or reaſons of their Paradoxical Fancies about the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which contradicted the General Agreement about the ſignification of A Beaſt, and its Ruling Parts, in the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe it is in the firſt place to be conſidered, That it is a true Obſervation of the Learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> That the Reaſon why the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> was not added at firſt to the reſt of the Books <note place="margin">In Praefat. ad <hi>Apocal.</hi>
                        </note> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which did afterwards give ground for que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning the Canonical Authority of it, was, That it did ſo openly point at the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, as the great Enemy of God, that it lay concealed in a few hands amongſt the Chriſtians of the firſt times, for fear of exaſperating the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt them. This does St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> make to be the ground, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke ſo myſteriouſly about the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <note place="margin">In 2. Ep. <hi>Theſſ.</hi>
                        </note> his Prophecy about Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 6. when he ſays, And <hi>now ye know, what doth withhold;</hi> the Reaſon they give for it, is, That if the Apoſtle had openly named the <hi>Romans,</hi> they would have accounted him, and all the Faithful, very peſtilent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Government.</p>
                     <p>This fear of the then Ruling Power, together with the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their ignorance of the application of the Characters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, becauſe they look'd upon their times as not at all concerned in thoſe things, may be very reaſonably judged to be the cauſe of the little care that the Fathers took to be wary in the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they gave of this Book. For they eſteemed it to be both a dangerous ſtudy, and alſo relating to things that they could not well judge of; and alſo to future times, in which they ſhould not ſhare; And might therefore (as <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> do expreſly ſay) bring themſelves unneceſſarily into great danger. And <hi>Jerom,</hi> in his Anſwer to 11. q. <hi>ad Algaſiam,</hi> and <hi>Primaſius</hi> upon 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 6. to the ſame purpoſe. This Account may the more eaſily be allowed from the general neglect of the Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> even in this Age, to which the chief things in <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Bp. <hi>Uſher,</hi> &amp;c.</note> it are by the ſevereſt Examiners of the Senſe of Scripture judged to belong; ſo as to be even laid aſide out of the Calendar for <note place="margin">* <hi>Homilies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> p. 69, and p. 316.</note> the daily readings of Scripture by Proteſtants themſelves, † who
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204884:225"/> nevertheleſs do give the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the name of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is then no great wonder, That <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> and ſome other of the Fathers, whilſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Pagan, ſhould be ſo willing to make the Beaſt in general to be the World, and the Seven Heads of it to be ſeven Wicked Ages of the World, as the ſum, or Recapitulation (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls it) of all the Apoſtate times; For in that way, the Sixth Head, ſaid in the Prophecy to be then in being, was not more applied to the <hi>Romans,</hi> than to all the other Wicked Nations in the World at that time; and the laſt Head, called the Beaſt, would not concern the then <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, becauſe it was not to come till after the end of that preſent Reigning Age.</p>
                     <p>And their willingneſs to take this ſafe way, might make them eaſie to be ſatisfied with ſuch ſmall grounds as theſe for it, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> is ſignified, Chap. 13. 2. to <note place="margin">1. Dan. 2. 40. and 7. 7, 23.</note> contain all the Four Beaſts of the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his own Body; though that be the ſame with what is ſaid of the Fourth Beaſt alone, that is, that he had devoured the other three. But this Apprehenſion might eaſily induce them, firſt to fancy the Beaſt to be at leaſt all thoſe Four Monarchies that are mentioned in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi> And 2. when that was done, they might as eaſily thereupon be brought to extend the notion of it to contain the whole World in it, from the repreſentation of the Seven Heads upon it, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeven being then generally accounted in the Learning of the Jews and Chriſtians, to be a ſignification of the whole ſum of the kind of things, with which it was joined; And then it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to fancy the Seven Heads to be ſome ſeven parts of time, that ſhould meaſure out that blaſphemous, or ungodly time of the World, from the firſt beginning of it, to the laſt end of it. And yet all the ground for this was nothing but that mention of the parts of the Four Beaſts in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the make of the Body of the Beaſt in the 13th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which the Fourth Beaſt in <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſaid to have devoured.</p>
                     <p>The Fathers that came after the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and that ſaw the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire turned Chriſtian, could not, it ſeems, ever bring it into their minds to think, That God would ever ſuffer the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to relapſe again into Infidelity, or to appear in the dreadful Characters of the Tyranny of the Beaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church; And yet they muſt ſtand to that, if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204884:226"/> 
                        <hi>Babylon</hi> to be <hi>Rome,</hi> or the future times of the Beaſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. They therefore interpret <hi>Babylon</hi> to be the General City of all Wicked Men all the World over, and the Beaſt to be the World of Wicked Men; and the Seven Heads to be either all the Tyrannical Powers of the World that had, or ſhould perſecute the Church of God, or all the Wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors only of that Time, Heathen, or <hi>Arrian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That which might the more eaſily diſpoſe them to this, was the Clamours of the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> againſt the then Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Party, that they were the People of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is ſo dreadfully ſet out in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> For it was very obvious for any, that had zeal enough, to make the Change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the Change of one of the Heads of the Beaſt; and ſo to account the Sixth Head to be the Heathen Emperors only, the Seventh King to be the ſhort continuance of Imperial, and profeſſed <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> under <hi>Conſtantius, Valens,</hi> &amp;c. as the time of the Seventh King is deſcribed; And the Eighth King, called The Beaſt, to be the return of that which theſe called Idolatry and Blaſphemy (but others Orthodoxy) under the reſt of the Emperors that ſucceeded, and that were in the time of this Charge in power.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider, That by ſome of the beſt Learned, and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> Dr. <hi>More.</hi>
                        </note> Interpreters of this preſent Age, the change of Religion in the Imperial Head, is made to be the end of the Reign of that Head, it will appear very reaſonable to judge, That theſe Clamours of their Adverſaries might be thought to have ſome ground for them, if they ſhould allow The Beaſt, and Heads, to be <hi>Roman</hi> Powers only: And this Conſideration might very well make them conclude, that <hi>Babylon</hi> could not be <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Heads of the Beaſt to be ſo many Succeſſions of <hi>Roman</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at leaſt if they thought it to be undoubted, That the then called Orthodox Party could not poſſibly be concerned in the Characters of the Beaſt. For,</p>
                     <p>That the Orthodox were then charged by their Adverſaries with the Application of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Beaſt, to them, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. That which is the cleareſt Inſtance of this nature, is that which <hi>Bede,</hi> in his Preface to his Comment upon the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> ſays of <hi>Tyconius,</hi> an Eminent <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> and whom he commends for his Interpretation—He there ſays, That <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius,</hi> who had ſuffered in the Cauſe of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> with the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:204884:226"/> reſt of his Brethren, That he did apply all the Perſecutions in the <hi>Revelations</hi> to the Actions of the then preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt thoſe of his Party: And <hi>Primaſius,</hi> another of his Followers, does alſo in his Comment upon this Book, affirm much the ſame of him in his Preface. So alſo does the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Work upon St. <hi>Matthew</hi> (wrongly attributed to <hi>Chryſoſtome)</hi> charge the Governing party of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church about the ſame time, with much the ſame accuſations in ſeveral places of it; and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> informs us, Lib. 3. <hi>de Pontif.</hi> c. 11. That <hi>the Orthodox</hi> Africans <hi>were called</hi> Romaniſts <hi>by the</hi> Arrians, as a name of reproach.</p>
                     <p>Whatever was the true Reaſon of this new Interpretation of the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it is certain, that it was againſt the opinion of all the Fathers before, as the moſt Learned of the <hi>Roman</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters do often acquaint us; and as may be ſeen from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> in particular, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Contra Haereſ.</hi> And from <hi>Tertullian</hi> in <hi>Apolog. Victorinus,</hi> &amp;c. And there could be no greater Reaſon to move them to it, than the clamours of that diſcontented Party.</p>
                     <p>But after the inundation of the Barbarous Nations all over the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the ſettlement of their ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms within the Bounds of it, <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis,</hi> and <hi>Arethas,</hi> as if they had now plainly ſeen the diviſion of that Empire amongſt the Ten Kings, repreſented by the Ten Horns of the Beaſt, ſeem to be not ſo well ſatisfied about the Myſtical way of Interpretation, which they had received from thoſe before them. But yet for fear of fixing the Characters of <hi>Babylon</hi> upon the then preſent times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they are very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of determining any way: They ſhow how many mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>Babylon</hi> may have in it; it may either be <hi>the whole World</hi> of the Wicked in general, or <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> or Old <hi>Rome,</hi> or New <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Seven Heads of the Beaſt may be either all the wicked Emperours, or Seven Ages of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet when they come to bethink themſelves again, <hi>Babylon muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> be <hi>Rome</hi> with them, according to the Ancient Fathers; and yet that it <hi>cannot</hi> be Old <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe that had loſt all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Empire, (And then what <hi>Rome</hi> can it be elſe?) And that Antichriſt, when he comes, muſt be a Monarch of <hi>Rome.</hi> See <hi>Andreas Caeſarienſis</hi> on the 13th and 17th Chapters of the <hi>Revelations.</hi>

                     <p> All which ſhows, That the only thing that can be depended upon, as the Authoritative ſenſe of the Ancients, is their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Agreement about the nature of the 4th Beaſt in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and about the relation of the Beaſt in the <hi>Revelations</hi> to it; And the immediate conſequences of that unanimous conſent.</p>
                     <p>If now it ſhould be thought to be a great prejudice againſt the clearneſs and eaſineſs of the Proteſtant Applications of the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> That that Interpretation was never heard of for many Ages together, after the time that the beginning of the Apoſtacy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is dated from by Proteſtants: <hi>Baronius</hi>'s Teſtimony concerning it, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer to that, who (as <note n="*" place="margin">Divers Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, p. 119.</note> Dr. <hi>Barnard</hi> obſerves) does acknowledg, That there was not an Age in which ſome Learned Man or other did not appear in this charge of Antichriſtianiſm upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And we have already ſeen the Charge of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Arrians;</hi> and if that ſhould be eſteemed to be nothing but the unreaſonable clamours of Hereticks, Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>'s <note place="margin">Lib. 4.
